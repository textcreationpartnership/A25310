            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FAir <hi>Albion</hi> had for many years enjoy'd all the
pleaſures that Peace and Plenty could afford, and by a long diſcontinuance
from War, ſeem'd to have degenerated from thoſe inclinations to Glory which
have been accounted natural to the People of that Famous Iſland; the laſt
time they carry'd out their Victorious Arms, was againſt their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on
the <hi>Belgick</hi> Coaſts, where after many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proofs of Courage and
Ability on both ſides, the Quarrel proceeding chiefly from Emulation of each
others Power and Trade, a firm and laſting Peace was concluded between them:
And now <hi>Brito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mardes</hi> the Second of that Name, King of <hi>Albion,</hi>
having againſt his natural diſpoſition been obliged to ſpend the
firſt and better part of his Youth in all thoſe hazards and difficulties
which a Civil War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bowels of his own Countrey, and a twelve Years
Exile abroad laid him open to, he at laſt, to his wonderful ſatisfaction,
finds himſelf at liberty to follow the current of his own Humour, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to Sacrifice the remaining part of his Life to the ſoft
temptations of Love and Pleaſure: But ſee the fallibility of Humane
Reſolutions, and how eaſily Providence can diſappoint our firmeſt
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, for though <hi>Britomardes</hi> knew how to improve his Minutes
of Love and Delight to as great advantage as any Prince in the World, yet he
could very rarely find himſelf diſengaged from thoſe weighty Cares that
neceſſarily attend the Thrones of Great Princes, or from the
apprehenſions of ſome<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106649:4"/>impending Dangers which the many
diſcoveries of Plots and Conſpiracies againſt his Life, imprinted in him:
He at laſt dying, without lawful Iſſue, <hi>Lyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> the Second,
his only Brother, ſucceeded, a Prince who in his Youth and Adverſity gave
ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proofs of his Virtue and Gallantry, that he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd himſelf
the Admiration of Forreign Countries, and the Delight and Love of his own, but
(I know not by what unhappy Councels thereunto incited) after his coming to the
Crown of <hi>Albion,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many Irregularities againſt even
the Peace and Safety of his own People, that they were obliged to call in
<hi>Anaximander,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Low Lands,</hi> to their
Aſſiſtance to defend their Lives, which they affirm'd <hi>Lycogenes</hi>
had expos'd and ſold to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydorus</hi> King of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and
to recover their Rights and Liberties which, ſay, they their King had
encroach'd upon and taken from them: <hi>Lycogenes</hi> had by his firſt Wife
(who was Daughter to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peer of <hi>Albion</hi>) two Lovely
Princeſſes to his Daughters, the Eldeſt called <hi>Artemiſia,</hi>
Married to <hi>Anaximander,</hi> the other <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Married to
<hi>Polycrates</hi> the Northern Prince. His ſecond Wife was
<hi>Meſſalina,</hi> Daughter of a <hi>Huge Prince</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and nearly Related to <hi>Boanerges</hi> the High-Prieſt, a Lady ſent by
Heaven to determine the Fate of Poor <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> and to ruine the
growing greatneſs of the <hi>Pagan Intereſt</hi> in the Kingdom of
<hi>Albion:</hi> She was, as to her Perſon, all that could be wiſht in a
great Woman, ſhe had a Majeſtick, Lofty Carriage, black Hair, delicate
ſparkling Eyes of the ſame Colour, a handſome Noſe, her Mouth extreamly
pretty when ſhe ſmil'd, her Face Oval, her Look demure and ſullen, except
when ſhe was in Company with her Favourites; ſhe was tall and well
ſhap'd, and to<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106649:4"/>thoſe who only look'd on her, ſhe made
lovely Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; ſhe took, according to the mode of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a great
delight in Muſick and Amour; Before her arrival at <hi>Albion,</hi> ſhe had
ſpent part of her time in the Court of <hi>Gothland,</hi> where ſhe behav'd
her ſelf with that Gallantry, and ſo far inſinuated into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of
that Court, that 'tis believ'd <hi>Lycogenes</hi> receiv'd his firſt
recommendation of her from the King of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> ſhe look'd upon
the Nobility of <hi>Albion</hi> either too juſt to their King, or too
unworthy of her Favours, to entruſt them with any part of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, and
therefore ſhe choſe to be beholding to the High-Prieſt and to
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> for Perſons that might at once ſerve both her Love and
Ambition; and though <hi>Lycogenes</hi> did all to oblige her, that a fond
over-weening Love could prompt a Man to, yet he found it more than a difficulty
many times to prevail with her to keep within ſuch rules as were moſt
agreeable to his Honour, and requiſite for the Peace and Security of his
Kingdom; <hi>Meſſalina</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Lycogenes</hi> Acceſſion to the
Crown, upon the Height and Eminence of her new Station, ſeem'd to have
receiv'd a new Air and Temper too; for during the Reign of <hi>Britomardes</hi>
(her <hi>Lycogenes</hi> then but a Subject) ſhe bore her Grandeur with that
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Complaiſance and Condeſcention, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Renown
of her Prideleſs Meen and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out-ran the very Fame of her Beauty,
and the ſame Poetick Raptures that daily Deified the one, built Altars too to
the other. All Tongues were full of her Praiſes, and there wanted not her
Applauſe even in all Corners of the World. But as if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had tried to
match her own Mutability in that Change which the Advance to a Crown ſoon
wrought through her whole Temper and Carriage; the<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106649:5"/>Anointing
Drops ſeem'd to have infuſed ſo ſtrange a Spirit of Ambition and
Haughtineſs, that her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Deareſt Darlings and Favourites were then
thought ſcarce worthy the Honour of being her Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, inſomuch that
that Univerſal Quire that before had ſo chanted her Praiſes, were all of
a ſudden ſtruck dumb; whilſt the Exaltation of her Pride, with that of
her Glory, had infinitely rebated the edge of the late popular Veneration. But
as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted as ſo haughty a Behaviour ſoon made her, not only by the
People, but the very Courtiers of <hi>Albion;</hi> We are to conſider 'twas
in the Days of her more humble State, and gentler Charms, that ſhe gain'd the
Heart of her <hi>Lycogenes.</hi> 'Tis true, as her Pride became a Fault,
however it brought one Vertue with it, in giving a Check to her former
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Intrigue; her ſometimes Favourites (upon her Aſcent to a
Throne) being now a little removed to a Diſtance unworthy of Graces ſo
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime. The long expected and long ſigh'd for Day of her Imperial Dignity
being come, ſhe could not without abundance of Regret behold thoſe Wrinkles
Age had already made in the Face of her <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> ſhe would often
ruminate on the Senſible Decay Time and continual Cares had wrought in the
Strength and Vigour of the King her Husband, ſhe could not conſider his
weak and ſeldom Careſſes any otherwiſe than as <hi>Memento Mori</hi> to
her own Glory and Ambition; ſhe ſaw many whom the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall I
ſay Injuſtice of <hi>Lycogenes</hi> had render'd cold and diſaffected to
his Intereſt, gaping with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a ſpeedy Change; ſhe was not
inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the moment of his Death would probably be the Eternity of
her Ruine, and that at leaſt her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if not her Life, would be
endangr'd; theſe<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106649:5"/>Conſiderations would often perplex the
Mind of <hi>poor Meſſalina,</hi> and would often check lhe current of her
Joy even in the height of all her Glory.
<q rend="inline">'What? would ſhe cry, 'muſt this be the weak
Foundation whereon all my future Hopes muſt reſt? Muſt all my Glorious
Projects lean on the uncertain Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Feeble Husband's Life? Shall the
preſent poſſeſſion of a Crown ſeem ſo to tranſport my Thoughts,
as to leave me careleſs of all future Contingencies, or ſhall I think the

that like a cheating Gameſter, I can be willing to refund, or lay down my
Royalty? No, no, <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalina,</hi> think of the Grandeur of thy Mighty

Thoughts of Unhappy <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> which were yet heightned afterwards
by the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Counſels of Count <hi>Davila,</hi> and Father
<hi>Pedro,</hi> her two chief Aſſiſtants in all her Conſultations, and

<hi>Boanerges</hi> the High-Prieſt, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of the Pagan
Faction in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Albion.</hi> Theſe two, according to their
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, draw firſt a Scheme of what they had to do, and then like
crafty Workmen, proceed to<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106649:6"/>the Manner, Time, and Place for
the execution of their Projects; they ſoon come to a determination of the
manner of their proceedings, for being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the main points whereon
all the Queens Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſeem'd to depend; to wit, Amour and Religion,
(two things ſo relative and reciprocal to each other all over <hi>Italy</hi>
and great part of <hi>Gaule,</hi> that you ſhall ſeldom ſee a Devotee
without the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of her <hi>Enamouratto,</hi> or a Man at his Prayers
without mingling ſome pithy Ejaculations to the Saint that kneels by him)
that they ſeem'd to have little elſe to do than to make ſeaſonable
applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Queens humour, as time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould give
leave. The Count was a tall ſlender Man, well ſhap'd, black Ey'd, and
quick, a large Noſe, but thin Fac'd, facetious in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and
after the Italian way Muſical; he had been well acquainted with
<hi>Meſſalina</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had without any ſignal reaſon
to deſpair, made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral addreſſes of Love to her; He was deſign'd
and ſent by the High Prieſt <hi>Boanerges,</hi> to make what efforts he
could on the well known Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> though he came
not ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided but that it was generally thought the Queen defray'd
even the expence of his Courtſhip: Father <hi>Pedro</hi> was to ply the other
weak ſide of <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> and by his Inſinuations of an
implicit faith to be given to every thing, he ſhould aſſert ſhe was to
uſe her utmoſt power and influence with <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> to promote and
put in execution without reſerve, whatſoever ſhould be propoſed as
advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Intereſt: This was the purport of their
Commiſſions, which they were to manage with all the Diſcretion,
Secreſie, and Expedition ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106649:6"/>The Queen happening to be indiſpoſed a
while after the Counts arrival at Court, he was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to defer the
payment of his private devoirs for four or five days, though the ſatisfaction
her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was pleaſed to expreſs for his arrival, was thought to add
much to her recovery; She let him know about a Week after his coming, ſhe was
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive his Viſit that day after Dinner, and to avoid all
inconveniency that might ariſe from the multiplicity of Attendance at the
Pallace Royal, ſhe takes her Chair privately, and croſſes over to St.
<hi>Jaques,</hi> a ſmall half Mile from <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
into her Cloſet, ſhe with impatience waited the coming of the Count, having
before given Orders to admit him without Ceremony; the Count by what
miſchance detained is uncertain, came not till two hours after the time
appointed, and being conducted by <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> one of the Queens Women
to the Cloſet door, went in, and found <hi>Meſſalina</hi> thrown upon a
Couch faſt aſleep, whereupon he ſtop'd, and being about to withdraw, the
Queen awoke, and perceiving the Count, ſhe ſtarted up in ſome ſeeming
diſorder: The Count fearing ſhe was diſpleaſed to have been ſeen in
that poſture, was in great confuſion whether to ſtay or go, till the
Queen making up to him, ſaid,
<q rend="inline">'My Lord, this is a piece of Gallantry in you
extraordinary, to make a Lady wait thus long for your attendance; I know not
how you will be able to acquit your ſelf from the juſtice of my
reſentment, of which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have expreſſed great
apprehenſions:'</q> The Count was ſo abaſh'd at this ſhort but ſevere
repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that for a great while he could not make any reply; but at laſt
coming to himſelf he fell on his Knees and humbly implored her Majeſties
Pardon, telling<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106649:7"/>her he hop'd Her Majeſty was not now to be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of his readineſs to ſerve her with the utmoſt faculty of his
Soul; that ſhe could not be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the firſt time he had had
the honour to ſee her in her own Country, he had made ſo entire a
reſignation of himſelf and his intereſt to her will and pleaſure, that
it was not now in his power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any thing repugnant to her
ſatisfaction, that he was too ſenſible of her Juſtice, to believe that
one unfortunate error was able to blot out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a thouſand
demonſtrations paſt of the profound reſpect he always thought due to her;
that he hop'd his hearty repentance for this, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her not only to
confirm his Pardon for the preſent, but to give him aſſurance of her good
will for the future: The Queen who all this while with the greateſt
ſatisfaction imaginable, had heard the Count thus zealous in his Apology for
an errour, ſhe had reſolved with a great deal leſs difficulty to have
pardoned, ſtretching out her hand to the Count, told him roundly that ſhe
was ſufficiently ſatisfied of his good inclinations towards her, that
beſides the recommendation of her Kinſman the High-Prieſt, his own
perſonal merit had ſo wrought on her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as to make her reſolve to
commit a Secret of the greateſt importance to her Intereſt, that could be,
to his management and diſcretion, that as ſhe did already believe the
ſincerity of his Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo ſhe doubted the neceſſity of
her Affairs, would in a little time cauſe her to exact his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: The
Count was about to reply, when Madam Marchioneſs <hi>de Tomazo,</hi> the
Queens chief Confident, and Father <hi>Pedro,</hi> were come into the
withdrawing Room, and advancing up to the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, the Queen bid them enter,
where after the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106649:7"/>Ceremony they fall into a deep
Conſultation, the matter before them, was the means of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Pagan
Intereſt throughout <hi>Albion,</hi> and next the ſatisfaction of
<hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s Ambition, as to her continuance in the Regency in
caſe <hi>Lycogenes</hi> (which was very much fear'd) ſhould in a ſhort
time fail; they were each preparing to deliver their Opinion in this weighty
Affair, when news was brought that the King waited for <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s
Company, to make a viſit to the Queen Dowager; <hi>Meſſalina</hi> before
ſhe departed, gave them in Charge to deliver in Writing to her ſelf, within
three days, their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeverally, and told them that within three days
more ſhe would have another Conſult, wherein ſhe hoped they would come to
a final Reſolution: The Queen being gone, theſe three fell to deliberation
on the points already propoſed; after a great many Arguments they conclude,
that nothing but the Queens having a Son, could in any humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
ſecure both the Queens Power, and the Grandeur of their <hi>Diana</hi> and
her Temples in <hi>Albion</hi> after the death of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cogenes;</hi> for ſuppoſing, ſaid they, (which is
very much doubted) that <hi>Lycogenes</hi> live to bring in either by Fraud or
Arbitrary Power, the <hi>Pagans</hi> Religion in his own time, yet the root it
will take will be ſo ſlender and ſhallow, that one breath of the next
Succeſſor (being a Chriſtian) will be able to blaſt it, and in the mean
time there will be no proviſion made for the Queens ſatisfaction; and alas!
cries the Marchioneſs, the Queen can no more hope for a young Son from
<hi>Lycogenes</hi> now, than I can for a young Set of Teeth at threeſcore;
the Count ſmil'd to himſelf at the quaintneſs of the Expreſſion, and
as he gueſs'd at what her diſcourſe did tend to, ſo he could not but be
glad that ſhe<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106649:8"/>had firſt broke the Ice: I preſume,
ſaid Father <hi>Pedro,</hi> (addreſſing himſelf to the Lady) her
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty upon a due Conſideration of the Premiſes will not be offended at
what ſhall be propoſed by her Friends in order to her future as well as
preſent ſatisfaction, and becauſe things of this nature may better be
imparted to the Queen, by your Ladiſhip than by us, we ſhall refer our
thoughts of this point to your Ladiſhips management: Upon this they parted,
and the Count repairing to his Lodging, fell a ruminating on that days
Tranſactions, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think his Maſter the High-Prieſt's
buſineſs would come on very favourably; nor did he ſee any great reaſon
to deſpair of ſome ſucceſs in his own Amour, he conſider'd how
obligingly <hi>Meſſalina</hi> had entertain'd him in the Cloſet, and
began to make ſome random Conjectures of what ſhe ſaid ſhe had to
deliver to him, he remember'd the reports that had been given about Town
concerning himſelf, and how that the Queen had been pleaſed to ſay once,
ſhe believed Count <hi>Davila</hi> to be as capable of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Ladies

                        </gap>ſſalina</hi> went under in
<hi>Italy,</hi> upon the account of the young Baron of
<hi>Sanctiforé,</hi> a Gentleman that was generally thought to have made
<hi>Effectual</hi> Love to her; he could eaſily gueſs what entertainment
ſhe had with the King her Husband, who beſide a failing contracted in his
youth, had the heavy burthen of age and cares lying on him; he knew the Queen
young and vigorous, and that the miſtruſt ſhe had of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of
<hi>Albion</hi> in all probability, did reſtrain her from making any advances
of Intrigue or Amour with any of them; theſe and the like conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made him reſolve to ſound <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106649:8"/>with the firſt opportunity, and in the mean time to
preſs her to come to a reſolution concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter. The next Night
Father <hi>Pedro</hi> meets <hi>Meſſalina</hi> retiring into her
Bed-chamber after Play, and the Queen ſtopping, asked what they had done in
her buſineſs? <hi>Pedro</hi> told her he thought the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs had ere
this imparted their Opinions to her Majeſty, and implored her Majeſty not
to be offended with the freedom of their thoughts, ſince the preſent State
of Affairs could not poſſibly admit of any milder Reſolutions, he laid
before her the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of her Fortune, the danger of her Perſon, the
Age of <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> his Weakneſs, and Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; he preſt her to
conſider the merit of the thing, and how it would for ever advance the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Temples in <hi>Albion,</hi> and when ſhe objected her
Honour and Credit, he told her, her Station was above even Suſpicion, for
<hi>who durſt peep into the Cabinets of Princes?</hi> He told her he could
propoſe methods as ſecret as pleaſant, and begg'd her not to defer a
matter of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and which he fear'd every day might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
and make void: <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> whoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temper had bean long
check'd by the ſtiff rules of Majeſty and Greatneſs, began now to
ſoften and melt at the pathetick Arguments of Father <hi>Pedro,</hi> and
eagerly graſping him by the hand, told him, <hi>That if ever ſhe could
condeſcend to any part of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it muſt be upon
conſiderations more weighty than any of pleaſure; That ſhe wiſh'd ſhe
could live to ſee her Religion Re-eſtabliſhed, and a Son of her own
plac'd in the Throne of</hi> Albion; <hi>That ſhe could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without a
great deal of trouble conſider the faint Careſſes and weak Efforts of the
King her Husband; and confeſs'd, that though Glory and Greatneſs had

Lycogenes <hi>had raiſed her heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common Rank, yet ſhe could
not perceive but ſhe was ſtill ſubject to the common Failings of Fleſh
and Blood:</hi> The laſcivious Prieſt, who all this while was tickling
himſelf with the coming Temper of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> ſuppoſing he
had now rais'd her fancy, to the very Critical point indeed was reſolv'd to
preſs the Diſcourſe home; but ſome of the Ladies of the Bed-Chamber
coming up, the Queen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more words, walk'd forward into her
Bed-Chamber; Father <hi>Pedro</hi> at the ſame time retiring ſomthing
diſſatisfied with his ſuppoſed diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was making what way
he could to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but judging it not very late by the Company he ſaw
yet ſtirring in the Court, he reſolv'd to take a turn or two in the
Galleries that lead to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into the <hi>Forreſt</hi> of St.
<hi>Jaques;</hi> he had juſt turn'd the Corner of the firſt Gallery, when a
Young Lady makes up to him with all the haſte and ſeeming Concern
imaginable: <hi>O Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>my Lady has been in Bed almoſt

Door; I'le but juſt ſtep to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of</hi> Thunderlands
<hi>Lodging, and will be back in half an hour. Pedro</hi> was extreamly
ſtartled at this Adventure, but judging (as indeed it was) ſome Amorous
Aſſignation, and his Spirits, by <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>'s Charming
Diſcourſe, being a little before rais'd, he was reſolv'd to fill up the
vacant place,<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106649:9"/>and anſwer the Longing Ladies expectation; he
was confident the Man deſign'd muſt be one of his own Tribe, for by the
little glimmering of the diſtant Lights, he was ſure the Maid could not
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their Garbes, all that troubled him was to find the right Door, if
the Maid ſhould have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had open'd it, and he durſt not ask
her Ladies Name for fear of ſuſpicion: In ſhort, he tells the Maid
ſoftly, <hi>She muſt go back with him a little, for that he had ſome
Buſineſs of Importance to leave with her till morning;</hi> The Maid
readily returns, and being juſt come to the Door, <hi>he bids her make what
haſte ſhe could back, and he would defer his Buſineſs till then.</hi>
The Maid being gone, he opens the door and perceives they were of
<hi>Aſpaſia</hi>'s Lodgings, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Queens Confidents, and Wife to
<hi>Latroon</hi> an <hi>Iberian</hi> Count, and lately made Viceroy of that
Kingdom by King <hi>Lycogenes. Pedro</hi> was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Lady,
and remembred that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was reported to be very
intimate with her. <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> was about the Thirty fourth Year of her
Age, was always very Fair, had large Grey Eyes, very languiſhing and ſweet,
ſhe had a very fine Carriage, <hi>debonaire</hi> in her Converſation, and
Witty, a huge lover of Intrigues, and inſatiate in her Wantonneſs; She had
formerly been Lov'd by <hi>Polydorus</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls;</hi> as alſo
by King <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes,</hi> by whom ſhe was firſt recommended to
<hi>Latroon</hi> for a Wife; She ſeem'd to be the right hand of
<hi>Meſſalina,</hi> who would unload her moſt ſecret Thoughts in her
Boſom; She was a great Bigot in Paganiſm, and would often boaſt of the
Vertues and good Nature of the Pagan Prieſts; She had, as it ſeems, been
often Charm'd with the Converſation of Father <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106649:10"/>that night, appointed him to come to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Father
<hi>Pedro</hi> knowing the Lodgings, ſhuts the Door, and immediately repairs,
without Light, to <hi>Aſpaſia</hi>'s Bed, who by this time, with long
Expectation, was fallen into a ſoft ſlumber; he locks the Door of her
Bed-Chamber, and without ſtay, undreſſing, ſteals ſoftly in, and
claſping <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> in his Arms, ſhe preſently wakes;
Madamoiſelle <hi>de Elvira</hi>'s Beds head was near to
<hi>Aſpaſia</hi>'s, and ſeparated only by a ſlight parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which
obliged them to whiſper low; <hi>Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> fell a Cliding the

the intervals of their Amours, would whiſper and chat of all the little
Intrigues about the Court; Father <hi>Pedro</hi> asks her <hi>how the Queen
far'd, and whether</hi> Lycogenes <hi>had as yet been able to give her any

<hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſia,</hi> whoſe thoughts were pleas'd with this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of
her ſuppos'd <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> was quickly wrapt in Dream and gentle

manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Nights Intrigue; he was one while think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to riſe ſoftly
and get off without diſcovery, another while he hop'd by this accident, to
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> inſtrumental and aſſiſtant to his

diſcovery, ſince his Fortune was in his power; beſides,
<hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> for her own ſake, would be ſilent in the matter; ſo
that at laſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106649:11"/>to ſtand it out, and without
any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, turns himſelf about to his reſt: In the morning early
<hi>Cleone, Aſpaſia</hi>'s truſty Maid, gets up, and gives the ſignal
at her Ladies door, to the ſuppos'd <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> to riſe; Father
<hi>Pedro</hi> had taken care over night to draw the Curtains cloſe about,
and claſping <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> in his Arms, he tells her <hi>he was
mightily diſturb'd in his ſleep with a Dream concerning Father</hi> Pedro:

cries <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> I can tell you, that of late he is mightily in

<hi>Pedro</hi> has all the qualifications in the World, that may be requiſite
for the Conqueſt of the moſt ſtubborn Ladies heart; for beſides the

Father <hi>Pedro</hi> could ſo of a ſuddain advance himſelf into the

words, he rais'd his Voice a little, and withdrawing the Curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains, he at once
diſcover'd the Counterfeit <hi>Sebaſtain,</hi> and the real <hi>Pedro.
Aſpaſia,</hi> who at the latter part of his Words, had perceiv'd not only
the Deceit, but the Deceiver, ſeem'd to be in the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
imaginable, till Father <hi>Pedro</hi> firſt imploring her pardon, told her,
<hi>He was extreamly ſorry, if he rob'd her of the ſatisfaction of a more
worthy Bedfellow, that Fortune, and her Maids unwitting importunity, had
prevail'd with him to lay hold of, and improve that lukie minuite which his

im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to conſider whether it could be in the power of Man to reſist
ſo powerful Temptations, as yielding Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perſwaſive Opportunity.
Aſpaſia</hi> having with abundance of Patience heard the wanton Prieſt's
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, had by this time very well recover'd out of her amazement, and having
firſt reflected on the good Behaviour of the Prieſt in Bed, and the bad
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that ariſe from a diſcovery of this Nights
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106649:12"/>Intrigue, ſhe thought it her beſt way to make a virtue
of neceſſity, and cloſe with the Prieſt without farther jangling, ſhe
remember'd the Character ſhe her ſelf had given him, and had now
experimented the height of his perfections, ſhe could not perceive her ſelf
a loſer by the change, nay, rather ſhe had all the advantage of the
bargain, nor could the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Accident Afflict her, ſince the
ſatisfaction of her life lay chiefly in Intrigues; having briefly run over
theſe conſiderations to her ſelf, ſhe turns her ſelf with a great
deal of aſſurance to her Lover, and throwing her Arm about his Neck, ſhe
tells him, that ſince he had been an Ear Witneſs of her good Opinion of
him, ſhe thought it now to no purpoſe to diſſemble; that though ſhe
had not deſign'd her favours for him at that time, yet ſhe was too well
ſatisfied of his merrit to find fault with the error; that if ſhe
apprehended any misfortune to her ſelf, it was her fear that he had not found
the treaſure anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his hopes and expectations, and that
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhe might find her ſelf leſſen'd in his good Opinion
hereafter; the crafty Prieſt, who by this nights Accident had, to his
thinking, laid a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to all his future Projects huggs the
well-pleas'd Lady in his Arms, and after a thouſand reciprocal
Wantonneſſes, they ſwear an inviolable Friendſhip to each other: Father
<hi>Pedro</hi> repeats to her all the deſign and project of advancing and
ſettling the <hi>Pagan</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt during <hi>Lycogenes</hi> his life,
and, engages her to preſs the Queen continually to come to a ſpeedy
Reſolution as to the point of Regency and Succeſſion; prevails with her
to give him a faithful account from time to time of all Tranſactions between

<hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> and prepares to dreſs, when <hi>Cleone</hi> knocks at
her Ladys Door, to know if ſhe were ſtirring; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſia</hi>
deſires <hi>Pedro</hi> to retire into a Cloſet, and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on her
Night Gown opens the door to <hi>Cleone;</hi> the Maid having a while before
ſeen <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> with ſome Company walking in the Court Yard,
merrily ask'd her Lady when the Lover got out, for that ſhe had not ſeen
him go; <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> fearing <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> might ask
<hi>Cleone</hi> queſtions, thought it her beſt way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with
her own miſtake, and bid her wait a while for her farther Inſtructions; the
Maid had juſt retir'd to the Window of the Withdrawing-Room, when ſhe
ſtraight runs back and tells her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhe ſaw <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> in
the Court below making tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards her Lodgings; <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> in a great
fright runs to the Cloſet, and deſires <hi>Pedro</hi> to be ſilent and
ſtill, for that <hi>Sebastian</hi> was coming; Father <hi>Pedro</hi> who by
this time had got himſelf dreſs'd, thought it would be tedious ſtaying
there, and immediately opens the Cloſet Door and marches off, having juſt
got to the door going into the Gallery, he pops juſt upon the Queen and Count
<hi>Davila</hi> going to the Moſque at St. <hi>Jaques; Sebaſtian</hi> had
got up among the Queens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and had perceived Father <hi>Pedro</hi> coming
out of <hi>Aſpaſia</hi>'s Lodgings, he began to ruminate with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
what buſineſs Father <hi>Pedro</hi> could have there, and at that time of
day, and reflecting on <hi>Aſpaſia</hi>'s looſe Life, his jealouſie
prompted him to think that he had loſt his Aſſignation, and had been
ſupplanted the laſt Night by Father <hi>Pedro; Sebaſtian</hi> was but an

of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts; upon his Jealouſie aforeſaid he
immediately repairs to <hi>Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>'s Lodgings, to try if he could
make any Diſcovery; <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> to prevent queſtions, immediately
chides him for his Diſappointment, he tells her he came not ſo late but
that <hi>Cleone</hi> might have heard him knock; <hi>Cleone</hi> makes a little

and reſolving to be Reveng'dd, at leaſt on Father <hi>Pedro,</hi> he clears
up his look and falls a toying with <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> &amp; owns himſelf
to blame for ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt the time; in the mean while Father

kept, were in private diſcourſe, &amp; gueſſing at the ſubiect of it,

for his preſence, ask'd him to attend her to St. <hi>Jaques;</hi> This kind
reception and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, confirm'd the Count in his reſolutions of
diſcovering his love, and preſſing on the main buſineſs, ſo that he
readily uſhers the Queen through the Lodgings to her Chair, and in one of her
Coaches follows her to St. <hi>Jaques,</hi> where wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Antichamber
till the Queen had done her Devotions at the Moſque, he was ſent for by
<hi>Meſſalina</hi> to her Cloſet. The Count was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded between
hope and fear, that the trembled all over when he went in; he was conſidering
what the conſequences of his Attempt might be, if by his over-weening fancy
he ſhould have<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106649:13"/>miſinterpreted the freedom of
<hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s humour; it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd him to think of the dangers he
ſhould lay himſelf open to, in owning Love to the Wife of a Potent Monarch,
if ſhe were pleaſed to put a bad conſtruction on it, and in the leaſt
reſent it; ſuch were the doubts and fears of the Court before he came to
the Queen: But alas! theſe glooming thoughts were ſoon blown over, for
<hi>Meſſalina</hi> very graciouſly receiving him at the Cloſet-door,
and with an extraordinary gayety giving him her Hand, after a turn or two,
ſeated her ſelf on a Couch, and commanded the Count to ſit by her, and
turning to him, ask'd him merrily, <hi>what News?</hi> The Count by this time
was come to himſelf, and with abundance of aſſurance, graſping her

advice: How have I fretted when in thy long and grave Debates thou would urge
the neceſſity of — I thought Majeſty could live without Support,
vainly believing I could carb the Politition, as the Lover with my Frowns:
Forgive me, dear</hi> Tomazo, <hi>ſince at laſt</hi> I <hi>am reclaim'd.
The Court, my Dear, the Count will make us happy.</hi> The Marchioneſs, tho
amaz'd at this extraordinary humour of the Queen could not however, but gueſs
how affairs ſtood; and though ſhe had been pretty well ſatisfied of the
Queens Reſolutions to ſurrender, yet ſhe thought ſhe would have ſpent
a little<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106649:15"/>more time in Capitulation; however, ſince the
main deſign was in all probability anſwer'd, ſhe thought ſhe could do
no more than be ſorry that the Count had outleap'd her Frind Father
<hi>Pedro,</hi> and yet upon better conſideration ſhe did not believe it
impoſſible, if matters between the <hi>Count</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi>
did not ſpeedily anſwer her expectation, but that ſhe might be able at
laſt to make good Father <hi>Pedro's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queens</hi> thoughts were all this while taken up with
the <hi>Count,</hi> upon whoſe Name in ſudden raptures ſhe would often
call; <hi>Oh? my dear</hi> Davila; <hi>my Life, my Soul, my Deliverer my
Protector,</hi> would ſhe cry, till the Marchioneſs making up to her broke
off her Contemplations, by telling her it was late, 'and ask'd her whether
ſhe would 'go back to <hi>Alba Regalis? Ay, any where,</hi> reply'd the
<hi>Queen, ſo</hi> Davila <hi>be there.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> who all this

Heir, and fear'd all his Endeavours without one, would prove ineffectual. The
wicked Prieſt and other corrupted Miniſters about him, had buzz'd the
Neceſſity and the Merit of this ſo far, that Good <hi>Prince,</hi> he
told them,
<q rend="inline">'He would be no way wanting to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance

preſently ſnapt at this Gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſenſion, and communicate the

fair a ſtroke ſhe had made towards the accompliſhment of their deſires,
and her own Ambition, told them,
<q rend="inline">'She would leave all things to the advice and
will of the King her Husband; that ſhe did not altogether diſpare of the
bleſſing of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and of bearing a Son yet to her Dear

if the Powers above were not pleaſed to raiſe unto her a Son of her own to
Inherit the Crown of <hi>Albion,</hi> and to re-ſettle the <hi>Pagan</hi>

not altogether as yet in vain, ſo ſhe could not decend to particulars as to
the other.'</q> The ſubtile Prieſts who ſaw both the Cunning and the Zeal
of <hi>Meſſalina</hi> in this anſwer, went away with all the
ſatisfaction imaginable, concluding now they had nothing more to do than to
preſcribe a due method for the management of a <hi>ſuppoſitious

experience of the Capacity of <hi>Lyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> her Husband, to hope for the
leaſt encouragement or performace from him; and ſhe had too lately found
and approv'd the difference between the <hi>Count</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi>
to think of leaving her buſineſs unfiniſhed, or repenting the change
ſhe had made: No, no, ſhe was ſo far from relying on the Weakneſs of
her Husband, that ſhe was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually employ'd, in contriving
Opportunites to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

the <hi>Count,</hi> and the ſatisfaction ſhe had received at her laſt
Conference with him, had ſo enliven'd her hopes of an anſwerable Succeſs,
that among her Conſiderats ſhe would talk very aſſuredly of the
Buſineſs, and would many times be Calculating the hour and time of her
Delivery, as if ſhe had known her ſelf with Child by Inſpiration. But
alas! theſe were only the flights of a paſſionate Zeal, for when her more
lucid Intervals would give her judgment ſcope, and free conſideration,
ſhe found her principles too weak to infer ſo weighty Concluſions, and
was loath to let her hopes reſt on ſo weak a foundation. No doubt the
<hi>Count</hi> had been as obliging as a Man under thoſe cricumſtances
could be expected, and the vaſt temptations of Honour and Riches, beſides
the enjoyment of ſo beautiful a Lady as <hi>Meſſalina</hi> really was,
had without diſpute put a double Edge on his Vigour and her Expectation, but

during this amorous Juncture, conſidered both her Pleaſure and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,

the Count frankly, That ſhe ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her Misfortune, and that ſhe

as ſhe had intruſted him with all her Secrets, ſo ſhe doubted not of

ſhe ſhould ſtill retain her good Opinion of him, and wholly imputed the
Diſappointment to Defects of her; That however ſhe muſt make the beſt

mind of their Conſult and Reſolution, and that nothing but a Son and Heir
could ſecure her Honour, and ſettle the <hi>Pagan</hi> Intereſt in

                  <p>THE <hi>Pagans</hi> of <hi>Albion,</hi> had from the beginning
of the Reign of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes</hi> with great aſſurance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſome
hapy, and ſpeedy overtures for their eternal ſettlement in that Kingdom;
Nor had <hi>Lycogenes</hi> himſelf been wanting in his endeavours to
over-rule or deſtroy all that pretended to oppoſe, or queſtion his
proceedings againſt the Foundamental Rights of his Chriſtian Subjects, he
had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remov'd the moſt of them from all Places of Truſt, and
contrary to the known Laws of the Land had introduced Perſons, by the ſaid
Laws incapable to Serve; he had Rais'd and kept up an Army compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of
Mercenary's and Forreigners, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Terrify, but upon the firſt happy
occaſion to Oppreſs all that ſhould contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his Reſolutions; he had
for the firſt three years of his Reign, carry'd all things with ſo high a
hand, that the People of <hi>Albion</hi> from the higheſt to the loweſt,
were<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106649:20"/>in a ſtrange Confuſion to think of the diſmal
conſequences that would neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow from ſuch Arbitrary
Proceedings: and though they had by the ſubtile Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of a Court
Party of Divines, been Poyſon'd with that pernicious poſition of
Paſſive Obedience, yet they could not without a great deal of regret behold
all the fences and incloſures of their Laws, and Libertiy's thrown down and
tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, and be obliged to hold their Lives and Eſtates on ſo
precarious Terms as the will and diſcretion of an Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pack'd
Councel: what related to the private ſatisfaction of the King's humour they
did with all humility, and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alacrity ſubmit and yield to, but when
it was plain that the whole Kingdom was Deſign'd and Reſolv'd a Sacrifice,
to the Intereſt and Ambition of a few wicked Councellours, and a ſmall
party of Men, that had been by publick Acts of the Realm declar'd the
Inveterate and Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Enemies of all Chriſtians but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the
<hi>Albionites,</hi> they then began to ſearch into the meaſures of their
ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diligently to enquire how far they were obliged to pay
Obedience to the Commands of their Magiſtrates and Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernours; and realy
upon the ſcrutiny they<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106649:20"/>plainly perceiv'd their own
weakneſs, and the Impoſitions of their Enemies, who by this ſubtile
Doctrine had enſnar'd them to ſet their Hands to and Sign as it were their
own Deſtruction, ſeveral of the Great and Wiſeſt Men in the Kingdom,
had been Debating on this Subject, and all concluded in an acknowledgment of
their weakneſs in ſo manifeſtly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves and their
Country to the Capricious Humours, or Tyrannical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that very often
are found in the greateſt Princes, and therefore though from their very Souls
they wiſh'd all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs imaginable to their King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, yet they
thought their duty ſtretch'd too far on the Tenter-hooks, when by a blind
ſubmiſſion to irregular Commands they were oblig'd to forego the natural
principles of ſelf preſervation, and that by ſeeking officiouſly to add
to their Loyalty they muſt neceſſarily detract from their Judgments,
Conſcience, and Honeſty: But <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> who by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſcrutiny, and long experience of the Natures of the people of
<hi>Albion,</hi> (to his great ſatisfaction) knew how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the
Doctrin of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> (which he and his party, with great zeal
and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry had inſinuated and promoted) had<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106649:21"/>wrought on
his Chriſtian Subjects, thought he had laid a very ſure foundation for the
introduction of thoſe Novelties and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we have ſince had impos'd on
us, and was by the aſſiduous Inſtigations of his <hi>Pagan</hi>
Councellors prevail'd upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the total Extirpation, or at leaſt
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving of the Chriſtian Hereticks, as he call'd them, in his Dominions,
and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all he could do in his own life time, would be inſufficient
to aſſure and eſtabliſh the <hi>Pagan</hi> Faction and Intereſt,
unleſs he could find ſuch a Succeſſour as ſhould confirm and
ſtrengthen what he ſhould now begin, upon theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I
ſay, he was eaſily wrought on to conſent to any thing his Counſellors
ſhould propoſe for the benefit and eſtabliſhment of <hi>Paganiſm</hi>
in the ſaid Kingdom, and now what more remain'd, than that the Prieſts
conſult and find the moſt convenient and ſpeedy means to ſecure their
own Intereſts to indulge <hi>Meſſelina</hi>'s Ambition, and to ſooth
<hi>Lycogenes</hi> his Bigotted Zeal: Several ways were propos'd, and
ſometime ſpent in Arguments and Debates before they could come to a final
Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians of <hi>Albion,</hi> by ſeveral Acts of their
General Diets, had their Laws, their Liberties, and their Religion ſecur'd to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106649:21"/>them, and in all, or moſt of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for one
hundred years paſt, they had one or other expreſs Law againſt
<hi>Paganiſm,</hi> though none did ſo throughly diſable and leſſen
their intereſt in <hi>Albion</hi> as that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the
<hi>Teſts;</hi> and though ſome good <hi>Chriſtian Diſſenters from
the Church of</hi> Albion, were therein ſeverely included, yet they were
chiefly intended for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſuppreſſion of that
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Sect of <hi>Pagans</hi> in <hi>Albion, Lycogenes</hi> his private
Counſel therefore propoſed the taking <hi>away</hi> theſe
<hi>Teſts,</hi> as a neceſſary Preliminary for the introduction of
<hi>Pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm;</hi> the Project indeed was good, but how to bring it about,
was the difficulty, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the general Diet would hardly be
induc'd to abrogate thoſe very Laws which ſome of them ſo lately had
ſtickl'd for and promoted, and ſuch Laws whereon their own and the Kingdoms
ſecurity ſeem'd more <hi>immediately</hi> to <hi>depend</hi> (the
<hi>Pagans</hi> having in all Reigns been proved the irreconcileable Enemys and
malicious deſigners againſt the peace and welfare of the Chriſtians in
<hi>Albion</hi>) beſides, I ſay, this difficulty, they were obliged to gain
the conſent of Prince <hi>Anaximander</hi> and the Princeſs
<hi>Artemiſia,</hi> the Preſumptive Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of the Crown, for the
Abrogation of the ſaid Laws, and this indeed was the<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106649:22"/>great
buſineſs that ſtruck with <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> for as to what concern'd
the election of ſuch Members as ſhould ſerve his turn in the next General
Aſſembly, he bid them take no care, for he was ſure he could by his
influence procure ſuch perſons return'd as ſhould effectually anſwer
his utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations: With all ſpeed therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are employ'd
to negotiate with the Prince and Princeſs for their conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
and to lay before them the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Majeſty's Intentions in that
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that his Majeſties great and only alm was for the more general
accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all his Diſſenting Subjects, and that as their
Highneſſes could not believe that his Majeſty would reſolve on any
thing to their prejudice, ſo he did not in the leaſt doubt of their
Highneſſes ready concurrence in ſo pious an undertaking; but alas poor
<hi>Lycogenes</hi> and his Penſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Counſel had far overſhot
themſelves, when they believed ſo wiſe a Prince as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naximander</hi>
could be ſo barefacedly decoy'd into an aſſent to a matter ſo
neceſſarily and plainly prejudicial to his own and his Princeſſes
intereſt, as well as to a Kingdom and People, they had reaſon to reſpect
and take care of as their future loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and preſent hearty
Friends, they were not unacquainted with the meaſures<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106649:22"/>
                     <hi>Lycogenes</hi> had taken from the beginning of his Reign, ſo
directly contrary to the Princeſs his Daughters Intereſt, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and deſtructive to the Chriſtians, and that by pure force he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
obtruded ſo many illegal things on his ſaid Chriſtian Subjects, that he
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Lycogenes</hi> could retend to make him or his Princeſs
inſtruments of their further oppreſſion and miſery; ſuch were the
Princes reſentments, and ſuch was the reſult of <hi>Lycogenes</hi> his
endeavours to make him and his own Daughter Parties for the Subverſion of
Chriſtianity in <hi>Albion;</hi> and now immediately a grand Gonſult is
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to conſider of <hi>Anaximander</hi>'s reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of ſome
other way to promote the grand concern: In the mean time
<hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalina</hi> had been tormenting her ſelf with the Apprehenſions
of her utter diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for though ſhe had kept a conſtant
correſpondence with the <hi>Count,</hi> ſhe could not yet perceive her
affairs go on ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly as ſhe had promiſed to her ſelf, and
the loſs of ſo much time, to her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, did very much qualifie the
ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhe received in her Amour; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tho' ſhe had
<hi>promiſed</hi> to repair to Art and Policy, to ſupply the <hi>preſent
defects of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſhe could not reſolve to abandon the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106649:23"/>Love and Service of the <hi>Count:</hi> Nay, upon mature
conſideration, ſhe concluded, that the continuation of her Amour with him,
could not be any way prejudicial to the other deſign they were now
undertaking, for ſuppoſing ſhe ſhould really <hi>conceive</hi> any
conſiderable time after the feigned report of her being with Child, the
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of the report of this could not any way be prejudicial to the real
truth of the other, the aſſured Birth of a Prince being all that could be
expected or deſir'd; and conſequently, any reflections on the other would
vaniſh as a miſtake, which Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ſuch caſes are very often
ſubject to. The <hi>Marchioneſs de Tomazo,</hi> would daily encourage her
belief of ſucceeding, and promiſed her aſſiſtance, by imparting to
her a Secret to help Conception; the <hi>Queen</hi> was wonderfully pleas'd,
even with the Flattery of the old Matron; but for fear of the worſt, was
reſolv'd to have the other Project ſpeedily ſet off foot, ſhe went to
the King's Apartment immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear what they had reſolv'd on, and how
it was agreed to be manag'd, where ſhe found the truſty Cabal in hot and
cloſe debate: She had order'd <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> the <hi>Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs de
Tomazo,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Father Pedro</hi> to be there, &amp; <hi>Lycogenes</hi>
had introduc'd the <hi>Count</hi> &amp; <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orchetes</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106649:23"/>the Chief Commiſſioner of his <hi>Court of
Conſcience,</hi> having <hi>exrerienc'd</hi> his Fidelity in matters of the
<hi>greateſt</hi> importance, and had rais'd him to that high Station
<hi>meerly</hi> to be an <hi>inſtrument</hi> in his <hi>future
undertakings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lycogenes</hi> upon the Arrival of the <hi>Queen</hi>
aroſe, requiring the Company not to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate till they had wholly
concluded on the means and manner of new modeling and ſetling the Kingdom of
<hi>Albion,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> likewiſe as ſoon as ſhe had ſeated
her ſelf commanded them to give her an account of their Proceedings.
<hi>Poliorchetes</hi> the Chancellor then riſing and making a profound
reverence to the <hi>Queen,</hi> deliver'd his Opinion thus:
<q rend="inline">'It is not unknown, <hi>mighty Soveraign,</hi>
how zealous I have been in bringing about and promoting whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be
thought advantageous to your intereſt; nor do I now preſume to recount my
Services for any other purpoſe than to manifeſt my gratitude and
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to engage again and again for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on any action and deſign
<hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties,</hi> or this Honourable Board, ſhall think meet to
preſcribe; I know the wiſdom of this Noble Company, cannot be wanting to
appoint ſuch Rules as ſhall for ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Pagan</hi>
intereſt in <hi>Albion,</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>your Majeſties</hi>
utmoſt Expectation;<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106649:24"/>notwithſtanding ſince the nature
of my Employments, and ſome years ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiery into the ways and
Inclinations of the people of <hi>Albion,</hi> may with reaſon have render'd
me capable of judging of the moſt ſecure, and convenient ways to deal with
them. I ſhall not be thought vain if I preſume freely, to deliver my
opinion in this Matter. The <hi>Albionites</hi> where they have received Graces
or Favours from their Princes, are like the wanton Aſs in the Fable, ready to
leap on their Maſter, and by the incouragement of two or three benefits, they
ſawcily approach him with their ill natur'd Jeaſts, and conſtantly
peſter him with their rude Importunities, but when too much Indulgence has
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them Inſupportable, do but ſhow them the Rod, and like Children
they ſhrink, and with patience ſubmit to the Juſtice of your Correction;
You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Inſolence in <hi>Perkin</hi>'s Rebellion, when with
unbounded Blaſphemy they would threaten the Safety and Honour of our Royal
Maſter, and yet the Sword of Juſtice was no ſooner unſheath'd againſt
them, but with horror they fly, and call even to the Mountains to cover them,
you have heard with what patience they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Tryals, and
reproached<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106649:24"/>even my Sentence with their <hi>Baſe
Servile</hi> Sufferings, my advice therefore is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of the
Great <hi>Polydorus,</hi> to get an Army of <hi>Pagans</hi> from
<hi>Iberia</hi> and <hi>Gothland,</hi> and ſo to Dragoon them inro a civil
compliance, Oh! that every year would produce a Weſtern Expedition, I'de
ſoon rid the Kingdom of all our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt's, and make every Circuit more
Terrible than an Inquiſition, we have too long nurſed them with the Milk of
our Affection, and like the profligate <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they grumble at
their <hi>Manna, Albion</hi> has Surfeited on Eaſe and Proſperity, and the
Feavour can't abate but by leting of Blood, let us make a full Harveſt of
theſe Hot-headed Chriſtians (as they boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) and at once
root out theſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Diſturbers of our Peace: The Queen who was
naturally of a malicious ſullen Temper, and who was not ignorant how
ſtubborn and a verſe the <hi>Albionites</hi> were to her Intereſt, had
heard <hi>Poliorchetes</hi> ſpeak with a bundance of ſatisfaction, but
being willing to hear what the reſt would propoſe, giving thanks to the
Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſhe expected with impatience their Thoughts and Opinions. When
<hi>Pedro</hi> riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, ſaid he could not but Applaud the Zeal and
Opinion of <hi>Poliorchetes,</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106649:25"/>and wiſh'd that his
deſign could be as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed as propos'd, that his averſion and
malice to the Chriſtians of <hi>Albion</hi> had inſpir'd him with ſuch
deſires of Revenge, that with <hi>Nero</hi> he wiſh'd they had all but one
Neck, and that he among his Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, did not doubt to find thouſands that
would ſtrive to be their Executioner, but that to his ſorrow he fear'd the
Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours project, however well deſign'd, would not be feaſible, for
beſides the Alarm that Forreign Auxiliaries would raiſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the
Kingdom, the natural antipathy, that the <hi>Albionites</hi> had both to the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Iberians</hi> was ſuch, that they would incontinently
riſe to Repel and Deſtroy them, and that if thoſe Foreigners ſhould
fail in their Attempt, the reproach of the deſign would be wholly thrown on
<hi>Lyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> and his Court, and that it would beget ſo implacable a
malice in the Heart of the <hi>Albionites</hi> (who were moſt of them
Chriſtians) that he might juſtly fear a general revolt, and thereby the
total ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Albion</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, his
opinion therefore was, that they ſhould rather enſnare and delude them, and
ſo at advantage cut them off and deſtroy them, tis known ſaid he how
wonderfully our fraternity have promoted<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106649:25"/>the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Intereſt by their ſubtile and ſecret Plots and
Contrivances, have not we by fomenting and raiſing Diviſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
Regular and Diſſenting <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>Albion</hi> more
weakened the ſtrength of the pretended Reformado's than ever
<hi>Polydorus</hi> by his Dragoons or Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Albion</hi> (with
ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>) is not by publick Hoſtility to
be forc'd, they are valiant in their Natures, and ſtubborn in their
Principles, and though the hopeful Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi>
and <hi>ſweet Non-reſiſtence</hi> has been uſeful unto us, and lull'd
them for a while, yet it may be dangerous to raiſe thoſe <hi>ſleeping
Lions</hi> within them, leſt we too late <hi>repent</hi> our over-fond
Credulity, and to our ſorrow feel the effects of their
<hi>reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> ſet your Policies on work if you wiſh to prevail,
and if you muſt <hi>ſtrike,</hi> let it be in the <hi>dark;</hi> we all of
us know we are ſick, and out of order, but few of us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the root and
cauſe of our diſtemper, all diſintereſſed perſons would think at
firſt view, that we were now in a hopeful way of thriving, we have a King not
only a <hi>Pagan</hi> and our Friend, but zealous and reſolv'd to go through
with his work; but alas is reſolution ſufficient without means? Tis true,
by his power he ran ſercure us for<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106649:26"/>a while; but what will
that ſignifie to a laſting ſatisfaction? How do our Enemies wait and gape
for his death? And with the hopes of revenge after his diſſolution they
patiently ſubmit to their preſent Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we know the main Pillars
whereon they all lean, <hi>Anaximander</hi> and <hi>Artemiſia</hi> are their
delight and their hope, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Philadelphia</hi> waits too in
reverſion, and from <hi>theſe three</hi> do ſpring all our fears and
misfortunes, and I and my Brethren bear the Title of our great Prophet, and
ſuffer his Cauſe to be ſhaken by the weak inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>three
ſingle Lives;</hi> Oh Holy <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old,</hi> our firſt Holy Patron and
Founder, how would thy mighty Spirit fret and and grieve within thee,
ſhouldſt thou ſee the <hi>degenerate baſeneſs</hi> of thy unworthy
Followers? Where are the Records of all our Glorious Hero's that have trod on
the Necks of Emperors, and pierc'd the Hearts of Kings, to propagate and
vindicate our Holy Religion, can we forget <hi>Borgia, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Ravilliac</hi>
and others, who have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrificed themſelves for their Religion, and
for reaſons leſs conſiderable than ours, and can we tamely remit all our
preſent Advantages, and be bafled of our <hi>future hopes,</hi> by tue weak
puny oppoſition of <hi>three petty pretenders?</hi>'</q> No, no, continued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106649:26"/>he, let us lay hold on the <hi>preſent</hi> opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and at once finiſh our long wiſh'd for deliverance: Theſe <hi>three</hi>
muſt fall a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to our Prophet, and from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of that cauſe
will all our other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Pedro</hi> had always bore ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with
<hi>Lycogenes</hi> and <hi>Meſſalina</hi> that they look'd on his
Counſels little inferiour to Oracles, and though the execution of them had
always prov'd prejudicial, through their great violence, to the <hi>Pagan</hi>
Intereſt, yet they could not but value the ſincerity of his meaning, and
always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded his wiſe apprehenſions, they knew his propoſals in this
Zealous Oration were very conſonant to reaſon, and agreeable to their true
intereſt, but knowing that the Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> were upon theſe
three Princes, and that the leaſt baſeneſs and impoſition upon, them
would engage all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in their quarrel, they could not ſo
readily <hi>conclude,</hi> or reſolve upon any violence againſt their
perſons; beſides, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> in a ſmall Apology afterwards
inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Company, the <hi>inconvenience</hi> of letting the King
know any thing of this Project, if happily they ſhould all agree upon it.
<hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>though I know</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes's <hi>Zeal would
make him overlook a<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106649:27"/>thouſand difficulties, yet nature and
conſcience could not with any decency or reaſon be ſuppos'd capable of
being ſo wholly obliterated as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any barbarity upon the
perſons of his own children; but again, what may prove a ſufficient ground
of ſcruple in him, may at the ſame time leave us free and
diſintereſſed from every thing and perſon that ſtands in oppoſition
to our deſigns.</hi> The Company however upon the Conſiderations
aforeſaid were very unwilling to engage in <hi>Pedro</hi>'s Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions or
Propoſals, and incontinently deſir'd the <hi>Marchioneſs de Tomazo,</hi>
to give her opinion of this grand Affair. The <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> who had
<hi>been</hi> a Woman of Amour moſt of her time, and who now, though
<hi>Age</hi> had <hi>ungenerouſly</hi> depriv'd her of <hi>the power to
pleaſe,</hi> was very fond and Ambitious of being thought a Woman of
<hi>Intrigue,</hi> had heard the violent Counſels, and Propoſals of the
<hi>Chancellor</hi> and Father <hi>Pedro</hi> with a great deal of
<hi>impatience</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure;</hi> ſhe could not digeſt
thoſe rough and hard terms of cutting of Throats, Poyſoning, or
Aſſaſſinations, ſhe had been always us'd to Amorous Sighs, <hi>Billet
deux,</hi> and Aſſignations; therefore riſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Compliment
to <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> and giving a hard look on <hi>Poliorchetes</hi> and
<hi>Pedro,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106649:27"/>ſhe thus began: <hi>'Tis not without the
greateſt regret imaginable, that I find my ſelf obliged to contradict
perſons whoſe known wiſdom and experience in the world may with reaſon
claim an entire ſubmiſſion of judgment from me, and though the command
and ſervice of her Majeſty, may ſufficiently apologize for the freedom
and liberty of my opinion, yet I doubt not from the nature of the buſineſs
in hand to prove that what both theſe honourable perſons have delivered as
their opinions, if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, will be inconſiſtent with the ſafety of her
Majeſty, prejudicial to the</hi> Pagan <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in</hi> Albion <hi>for
ever, and extreamly difficult, if not impoſſible to be brought about; nor
do I need to ſay much to diſſwade this Honourable Company from the
following their propoſals, ſince</hi> Father Pedro <hi>has already evinc'd
and made clear the fallacy of the</hi> Chancellor's <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the
reſt of the Company have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew'd their diſlike of
Father</hi> Pedro's; <hi>I ſhall now therefore proceed to give my opinion,
and if I ſhall have the good fortune to convince your reaſons, and draw you
into a concurrence, you will then be ſo juſt to believe that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of my cenſue proceeds from other cauſes than that of meer contradiction; we
all agree in the main pint, that ſome courſe muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for
re-eſtabliſhing and ſecuring the</hi> Pagan <hi>Intereſt in</hi>
Albion, <hi>ſo as that it ſhould not<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106649:28"/>ſeem entirely to
depend on the uncertain life of the</hi> King, <hi>and though the opinion of my
ſelf and the</hi> Count Davila, <hi>who doubtleſs receives all his
meaſures from the Conclave, and from</hi> Boanerges <hi>the High-prieſt,
have been by theſe two Gentlemen oppoſed, at leaſt neglected, yet I have
not been ſo apprehenſive as to hear any new thing propoſed, as is capable
of making me or the</hi> Count <hi>recede from our former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am
ſure if it take 'tis the only effectual way to preſerve us entires; I am as
ſure 'tis as eaſie, as in a matter of that importance can be wiſh'd, it
may be brought about with ſo little diſcompoſure of the publick peace,
that it ſhall rather gain the general applauſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; will not
the attaining our deſires anſwer all expectations? what neceſſity of
cutting thoſe Throats which with abundance of eaſe we can make
inſtrumental and acceſſary to our deſigns, the ſuppoſition of an
Heir Male quaſhes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretenders in a moment; and ſurely</hi> Albion
<hi>is not ſo barren or ill natur'd as to deny</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes <hi>a Son. No,
no,</hi> (replys <hi>Poliorchetes,</hi> interrupting the
<hi>Marchioneſs</hi>) <hi>we have daily experience of the fruitfulneſs of
the Women of</hi> Albion, <hi>but yet we cannot apprehend how</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes
<hi>can expect to reap where he has not had the power, or the will to ſow:
The will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> (ſaid <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> ſighing) <hi>I believe her
Majeſty can vouch for, but to the ſorrow and<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106649:28"/>confuſion
of us all, he wants the power: Let us then</hi> (continued the
<hi>Marchioneſs</hi>) <hi>no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger deplore, but endeavour to ſupply
thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate defects of the King our Maſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider on what nice
points our Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt depend, time will not ſtay for vain and
fruitleſs wiſhes, and if we ſlip ſo fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, we ſhall
ſeem to deſpiſe providence, ruine our intereſt for ever, and fall the
reproach of our Enemies, and unpitied by all the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans <hi>throughout
the World. Polyorchetes</hi> had heard theſe laſt words with wonderful
ſurpriſe, for his thoughts having run wholly on the extirpation of the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> by Fire and Sword, he had not ſo much as dream'd of any
poſſibility of milder means, and now gueſſing at what the
<hi>Marchioneſs</hi> had inſinuated, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly tickl'd with the
project, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> That ſince ſhe had
propos'd ſomething extraordinary, ſhe would be pleas'd to explain her
ſelf, ſo as that they might endeavour to ſolve any difficulties that
might ariſe upon a ſtrict examination of the deſign: <hi>The
difficulty's</hi> (reply'd the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi>) <hi>are ſo ſmall, in
compariſon of that advantage we ſhall reap, that among us they will not
admit of a diſpute; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have had a preſident of what I
propoſe, which though it miſcarried in the main, yet it<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106649:29"/>was not for want of power, but will of ſome Partys concerned to
bring it about; That an Heir is abſolutely neceſſary to confirm and
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our otherwiſe fading hopes we all agree; and ſhall not we
ſubmit to neceſſity, and endeavour to reſtore by art what envious
nature, or curſt fortune have ruin'd or withheld? It muſt be ſo,</hi>
(reply'd <hi>Meſſalina</hi>) <hi>it muſt be ſo, and there is no other
to uphold my tottering Crown: It muſt be ſo, and yet my boding Soul
foretells it won't ſucceed; theſe ſaucy</hi> Albionites, <hi>will ſtill
be prying, and every ſtep I make will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. Rejoyce, Dread
Soveraign,</hi> (reply'd <hi>Polyorchetes</hi>) (who had already taken that
hint) <hi>the</hi> Marchioneſs <hi>has in one word fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed what the
united ſtrength of my dull brain could ne're attempt, but now the game is up,
I'll keep the ſcent, and work it on to a deſired perfection. Why ſhould
your Majeſty</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Pedro</hi>) <hi>deſpair at all of due
ſucceſs? Does your Majeſty want power, or friends, or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to act
what a Predeceſſor and Nameſake with ſo much diſadvantage had
effected if</hi> Philippo <hi>had prov'd but half ſo generous as is the
brave</hi> Lycogenes: <hi>Can you doubt the ſucceſs of any Enterpriſe
when you have ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſiſtance even from your Enemies? Could
ſhe carry on a deſign of the ſame nature even to the brink of
performance, ſo as to amuſe, nay, to convince all orders of the Kingdom of
the<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106649:29"/>reality of it? And can you doubt at laſt of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
She had a ſharp-ſighted Parliament, near five hundred of the wiſeſt in
the Kingdom to combat with, who were ſtrict in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
ſuſpicious of her dealing, and reſolute againſt any impoſition; ſhe
had the Nobility on one hand, the King her Husband of the other; and yet ſhe
baffled all but that narrow-hearted Prince, who like the Dog in the Manger
could wither eat the Hay himſelf, nor would ſuffer the Horſes; he had
ſeen himſelf incapable of re-eſtabliſhing the</hi> Pagan <hi>intereſt
by the aſſurance of an Heir, and was ſo covetous and mean as to hinder
the propagation of it by another, whereas your Majeſty ſtands on ſure
grounds, you have a ſtrong party in the Court of wiſe and able men to
adviſe you, you have a potent Army ready to protect and defend you, but above
all you have a Husband and a King to aſſiſt, and further you; who dares
even ſuſpect you? who would preſume to prove you? By your word, you
create an Heir, and your command ſettles the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever.</hi> Thus
<hi>Pedro</hi> ſpoke, and a general applauſe run through the whole Company,
there remained only <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> and the Queen to give their Sentiments
and Opinions, and <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> declaring in ſhort, that Father
<hi>Pedro</hi> had wholly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her thoughts and deſires in this
jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and that ſhe wholly ſubmitted to<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106649:30"/>the judgment
of the Queen. <hi>Meſſalina</hi> raiſing her ſelf, briefly gave her
reſolution thus: <hi>Nothing can give us greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and
aſſurance of ſucceſs, than the zeal and fidelity of you our beloved
Counſellors, and ſince our buſineſs peſſeth for a ſpeedy
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I ſhall need ſay no more, than that I do, and ſhall
aſſent to what the Majority of you,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Marchioneſs de
Tomazo, Aſpaſia, <hi>and</hi> Pedro <hi>have laid down; there remains
therefore no more but that you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conſult of the manner and method
of bringing it on, and from time to time to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate your advice to us; I
adviſe and think fit that</hi> Boanerges <hi>the High Prieſt our moſt
Holy Kinſman, have timely notice of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as alſo</hi>
Polydorus <hi>our Royal Friend and Ally, that they may take care to order
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Forreign Parts, ſo as that we way have the univerſal
aſſiſtance of all our Friends to promote a Project ſo highly
advantageous to all their Intereſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This gracious Speech and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was received with
unſpeakable joy by the Counſel, and Father <hi>Pedro</hi> ſtepping to the
Door, gave orders for private Thankſgiving throughout all the
<hi>Moſques</hi> in <hi>Albion,</hi> as alſo for Proceſſions? Feaſts,
and other expreſſions of joy; and having again ſeated himſelf, they
immediately<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106649:30"/>fall cloſe to the point. The firſt
buſineſs hey reſolve on is, That being five in number, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Count, Pedro, Polyor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetes,</hi> the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the
<hi>Marchioneſs de Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi> and <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> they ſeverally
have ſeveral Employments and Offices aſſigned them, for the more
effectual and ſpeedy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their buſineſs. The
<hi>Count</hi> who by his Office and Intereſt with <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerges,</hi> could
claim a Domination over the <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts, was to ſummon a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and to give them inſtructions how to diſperſe the News of
her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and to inſinuate, as if by Divine Inſpiration they knew it
would be a Prince, as alſo to quaſh any Objections or Doubts concerning it,
and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of the perſons: Father <hi>Pedro</hi> was to be made one
of the Privy-Council, and as he was one of the chief Contrivers at firſt,
ſo now he was to enliven and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the report of the Queens Conception at
the publick Board, and to repreſent it with all the ſeeming Candour
imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he was to ſilence all Diſputes and Conteſts that might
happily ariſe upon it, and to make motions to the Board, to give ſuch order
concerning her Majeſty, and the Child, as ſhould gain a General
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106649:31"/>Approbation and belief throughout the Kingdom, and though
there aroſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie whether it were not fitter for ſome other
<hi>Pagan</hi> Lords of <hi>Albion</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe this part, yet they
ſoon concluded on the ability of <hi>Pedro,</hi> who was better qualify'd to
repreſent it in handſom Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and conſequently would go down the
glibber, and paſs ſecure with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing they had ſo good
Vouchers as Privy-Councellors: The <hi>Chancellor</hi> being a Man of an
hardned Conſtitution, was appointed to wait with diligence againſt the time
of the pretended Birth, and by a poſitive Aſſeveration, if any

<hi>Meſſalina</hi> as Lady of the Bed-Chamber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She was to
Careſs the Ladys with the joyful News of the Queens Conception, and from time
to time inſinuate paſſages belonging to Child-bearing, to give an account
of the growth of the Burthen, and to make the thing feaſible ſhe was to
carry.<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106649:31"/>on a ſuſpicion or fear of a Miſcarriage, and it
being once granted that ſhe could poſſibly Miſcarry, included the
belief that ſhe was really Teeming: And now there was none but the
Marchioneſs remaining, who being a Woman, as is before ſaid, of a quick
Judgment in Intrigues, and who knew well how to manage an Impoſture of that
nature, it was laid upon her with Secrecy and Aſſurance to procure two or
three young wholſome Women whoſe time of Delivery ſhould critically agree
with the Queen's time allotted and ſet down by this Councel; the
Marchioneſs was not diſſatisfied with the Task, though ſhe could not
but be ſenſible it requir'd depth of Judgment, a great deal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Enquiry, and continual Care to manage them to a Hairs breadth, leſt any
unlucky accident might ſpoil the whole Intregue, but upon a little
conſideration ſhe remembred ſhe had heard an Inkling of a young
Kinſwoman of her own, how that through weakneſs ſhe had been forc'd to
ſurrender her Virginity to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of a young Spark, who had
ſince forſaken her, and had withal left her a ſure pledg of his Love and
Vigour, ſo that being ſo well encouraged at firſt ſhe readily ſubmits
to the Commands of the<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106649:32"/>Board, and engages upon Honour to
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Expectation; and now the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals being concluded on and
appointed, they diſperſe, and forthwith apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their
ſeveral Employments, and as a Prologue to their intended Villany, they give
out, among their own Party, at leaſt, the neceſſity of Unity in their
Prayers to their Saints and the Deity, to ſend their Majeſty's an Heir to
ſucceed him in his Throne and Dominions, and to ſettle their Holy Religion
in this Heretical Land, they cauſe Proceſſions and Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
Offerings and Supplications, to be made, firſt to the great Saint at
<hi>Loretto,</hi> then to St. <hi>Winifred;</hi> and they cauſe
<hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalina</hi> to repair to ſeveral Waters that are famous Antidotes
againſt Barrenneſs, thô at the ſame time they did not conſider
that the People look'd upon it very awkard and ſtrange, that the Queen had
never found out this way of preparing for Child-bearing before; but ſuch are
the practices of the Pagan Religion, that the greateſt Villanies and
Rogueries they intend to commit are ſtill preceded and uſher'd in with
great appearances of Sanctity; and now all things being in a readineſs; the
Queen declares her ſelf publickly to be with Child, and Orders were given for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106649:32"/>publick Thankſgiving throughout the Iſles, and in other
Forreign parts; Rejoycings and Feaſtings were made by the Kings Reſidents
and Ambaſſadors; eſpecially in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Gaule;</hi> as if it
were not enough to impoſe ſo great a Villiany on the whole Kingdom, without
enforcing them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate with the Deity in their Prayers, and to make
Petitions for that which really was not; but notwithſtanding all the
Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Advice to carry on this Intrigue, the People, eſpecially the
Chriſtian Nobles and Gentry of <hi>Albion</hi> were mightily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
with ſo improbable an Accident; &amp; though by reaſon of an
Indiſpoſition, which <hi>Meſſalina</hi> for ſome while before lay
under, the Kings weakneſs and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they could not readily
free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from a ſuſpicion of Treachery, yet they reſolv'd to

<hi>Meſſalina</hi> and all about her, the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ſt real occaſion of diſlike was, that the Queen
did not treat the Chriſtian Ladies of <hi>Albion,</hi> eſpecially the
Princeſs <hi>Philadelpha,</hi> with that freedom as the joy and pride of ſo
great a happineſs, if real, would naturally have prompted her to; for ſhe
would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it highly if ſhe could but obſerve any of the Chriſtians
making the leaſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106649:33"/>of her Breaſts, Belly,
her Look, or any other Symptome, by which Women in that Condition are eaſily
diſtinguiſhed; another great reaſon was, that ſhe ſeem'd to ſlight
the Pretenſions of the Princeſs <hi>Artemiſia,</hi> ſo as there was not
the leaſt intimation given her to be at the Queens Labour till within a very
few days before ſhe was Deliver'd; beſides, the Confidence of the
<hi>Pagan</hi> Party did ſtrangely ſtartle the People, when like Oracles
they would affirm that of neceſſity it muſt be a Prince: Theſe and many
other material circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances made the <hi>Albionites</hi> talk broadly of
the buſineſs; nor were <hi>Lycogenes</hi> and <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
ignorant of their Sentiments; however having the Power abſolutely in their
hands, they were reſolved to cut that knot which they found impoſſible to
untie, and ſince they had thus far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a buſineſs of that
importance, they reſolv'd to go through and bring it about, though with a
thouſand abſurdities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherences; for beſides the alteration of her
Reckoning, which proceeded partly from a fear of diſappointment if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that came firſt ſhould have brought forth a Girl, but chiefly to amuſe
the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry of the Court and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who would doubtleſs have
made <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106649:33"/>it their buſineſs in behalf of the Princeſs
<hi>Artemiſia</hi> and the Kingdom, to attend and watch that all things might
have been carryed fairly and above-board; I ſay, beſides the alteration of
her reckoning ſhe would give out upon every turn different places of her
pretended lying-in, ſometimes ſhe would give orders for <hi>R—d,</hi>
at other times ſhe would remove her fancy to <hi>H—</hi> Court, but in
reality St. <hi>Jaques</hi> was the place reſolv'd on, for <hi>Alba
Regalis</hi> the whole party diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow'd, becauſe by reaſon of the
multitude and concourſe of People that conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there, ſhe
could not poſſibly have been ſo privately Deliver'd as the Intrigue did
neceſſarily require; beſides, there was no conveniency for the Child to
be brought through the Galleries or Lodgings, but in the Palace of St.
<hi>Jaques,</hi> there was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio and a Moſque adjoyning with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of winding by dark Chambers, ſecret Paſſages, Trap-doors and dark
Corners, where not only one or two of the Women were with great ſecurity and
ſecrecy kept till the time of their delivery, but where the Queen might have
the Child foiſted into her Bed reaking and hot from the Womb, but in the heat
of all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue and deſign <hi>Lycogenes</hi> was unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106649:34"/>put in mind that by the Laws of <hi>Albion</hi> the
preſence of one or more of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prelates was to be at the Birth
of every Royal Infant indiſpenſably required; to reſolve this difficulty
a Council is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately call'd, and after ſundry debates it is concluded,
that ſome way or other muſt be found to bring all or moſt of the
diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part into a premunire, and ſo by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation either to
endanger their lives, or at leaſt to clap them up and ſecure them till the
Queens Delivery; accordingly a flaw was immediatly found and the Prelates
forthwith confin'd: and now nothing but the preſence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Philadelpha</hi> was fear'd, but what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the craft of the wicked
Jebuſites bring about? that Princeſs had unfortunately complain'd of ſome
ſmall indiſpoſition, when the Queen immediately takes the hint, and by
the means of <hi>Pedro</hi> and ſome other Malecontents, ſhe prevails with
her Phyſician to perſwade her to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Waters of
<hi>Baijae,</hi> though the Operation of thoſe Waters was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known
to be contrary to the Princeſs's Diſtemper, they being looſening, and
ſhe wanting Reſtringents, but her abſence was abſolutely neceſſary,
and therefore by any means to be obtain'd; the Princeſs<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106649:34"/>according to their wiſhes leaves the Court, and they were reſolv'd
to do their buſineſs before her return; and now all things to appearance
ſeem'd to favour the deſign, the time preſcrib'd drew near, their
greateſt Adverſaries were remov'd, the Court Party, and Pagan Prieſts,
with daily Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Shams were amuſing and taking off the attention of
the Chriſtians; all things ſeem'd ſmooth, and the Critical Minute was at
hand, when news was brought to <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> that one of the Women
was in Labour, immediately the Queen takes her Chair, and haſtes over to St.
<hi>Jaques,</hi> but before ſhe had well aſcended the Stairs, ſhe was
told, that Woman had brought forth a Girl, with which being for the preſent
confounded, ſhe deſcends, leaving before ſuch Orders as were
neceſſary; the other Women ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting their Times Daily and Hourly; and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ere three Days were over ſhe receiving ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Summons, repair
forthwith to St. <hi>Jaques,</hi> ſhe ſtays there all Night with long
expectation of Succeſs, early the next Morning ſhe receives the glad
Tidings that a Man Child was Born, which with all ſpeed was convey'd to the
Dormitory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to her Bed-Chamber, in the ſame reeking Circumſtances
it was Born in, and having before taken care for the conducting of it to the
Queens Bed, the Alarm is given at <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> that the Queen was in
Labour; <hi>Lycogenes</hi> had that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roſe ſomething earlier than
ordinary, and had croſt over to his own ſide on purpoſe to draw off the
Men with him, and conſequently to favour the Cheat, by leaving as few as
poſſible about the Queens Apartment; in the mean time Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell <hi>de

Crying for the preſent lays it gently in a large Warming-Pan made on

<hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s haughty Heart, which vaſt aſpiring Hopes had long
engaged, ſoftens again in Gentleneſs and Love: She had ſeen the Languets
of her Charming Count, and heard his gentle Murmurs with Compaſſion; ſhe
knew the great reſtraint he forc'd upon his Heart, when by reaſon of her
numerous Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and Viſitours, he had not opportunity to breath his
Love; ſometimes a Wink, an Amorous Look, or Sigh, ſhe would by ſtealth
return; or otherwiſe, in ſome Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Words, ſhe would diſcover her
Concern and Care, for his endearing Paſſion; but in ſuch dumb ſhows
alone, as there were more than Three Weeks ſpent, e're ſhe could
poſſibly engage, or ſpeak with him alone. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, her Beauty,

Alacrity imaginable Grant: And now the Prince having a Gallant, though ſmall
Fleet, equipp'd with all the ſpeed that could be, makes for the

things managed, that <hi>Lycogenes</hi> had not the leaſt Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the

<hi>Meſſalina</hi> had, that Night the fatal News ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, aſſign'd
Count <hi>Davila</hi> to meet her at St. <hi>Jaques,</hi> and the Marchioneſs
<hi>de Tomazo</hi> in the Abſence eſpecially of <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> (who a
while before was gone over to her Husband <hi>Latroon,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Iberia</hi>) being her chief Confident, was order'd to attend. The Count,
who had once or twice been Tardy in the Hour appointed, thought now by early
Diligence to make amends, ſo that by Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he was gotten up into the
Bed-Chamber, being a private Retirement for <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> during the
King's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at any Time, or her Indiſpoſition; where ſitting down
near the Bed, he waited with Impatience for the Queen; and in the mean time,
was contemplating on the Happineſs of his Enjoyments; by this time,
Darkneſs had o'er-ſpread the Earth, and the Marchioneſs being to give the
Orders for the Candles of that private Apartment, eſpecially at that
ſeaſon, the Count found himſelf for ſome time very ſolitary, and
without Light, and being about to make to the Door, he heard ſome ſtirring
and breathing on the Bed, when drawing the Curtain ſoftly, he could juſt
perceive by her Cloaths, it was a Lady faſt aſleep; the Count was mightily
amaz'd at firſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf, he thought it doubtleſs was
the Queen, who had retired thither before the Hour appointed, and had prevented
even his Dilligence in coming; ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple, throwing himſelf on
the Bed, he claſps<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106649:39"/>the ſuppoſed <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
in his Arms, and having in his firſt Tranſports run with his curious Hand
o'er all the private Receſſes of her Charms, he was juſt preparing to
attack the Fort, mingling with his Kiſſes, his ſhort Amorous Sighs,
foretelling Tranſports, Extaſies and Dyings; when <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
haſtily comes in with a ſmall Taper in her Hand, and calls:
<hi>Tomazo,</hi> is not my Dear Count yet come, <hi>Tomazo?</hi> The
Marchioneſs at the very Inſtant, whether the Amorous buſtling of the
Count had operated on her waking Fancy, or whether by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of
ſome pleaſing Dream, ſhe was thereto incited, Cryed paſſionately out,

<q rend="inline">"Make haſte my Dear <hi>Antonio,</hi> make
haſte, the Marqueſs will be here and Ruine us."</q> The Queen who had heard
her ſpeak thoſe laſt Words, by this Time had opened the Curtain, and
there diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Count, raiſed on his Knees between <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s
Leggs, and in a poſture which plainly diſcovered the drift of his
Intentions; never were Three Perſons (for by this Time the Marchiones had
wak'd) ſo ſeverally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed and confounded; the Queen with Shame
had ſhown her Face glowing Red, and then with Anger ſtraigt grown Pale; the
Count, though in that awkward Poſture, was ſo much confounded, he could not
move himſelf, nor had the Senſe to cover the Marchioneſs, or his own
Nakedneſs; but between Wonder, Anger and Fear, was wholly bereft of even
Senſe or Motion: The Marchioneſs, whoſe Age and Experience had rendered
her familiar with the ſame or the like Adventures, was not ſo much
Aſhamed of being ſeen in that Condition and Poſture, as Apprehenſive of
the Queen's Reſentments, if, as was probable, ſhe ſhould ſuppoſe any
Amour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Count, her Lover, and whom ſhe had but that Night
appointed, and deſign'd for her own Uſe and Service. In ſuch diſtracted
Thoughts and Manner, did they for a great while ſtand and gaze, and wonder at
one another, without one Word between them, till<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106649:40"/>at laſt
the Queen, whether heightend in her Fancy, with the pleaſing ſight and
intended Action of the <hi>Count,</hi> or upon due conſideration, believing
and judging, by the Words ſhe had heard the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> utter,
that it was wholly a miſtake on all ſides, burſt out in Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and
turning her Face a little, told the Count in Drollery, the Weather began to be
Cold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would do well to take care and cover his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
and himſelf. The <hi>Count</hi> with this ſhort repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was thoroughly
wak'd out of his Trance, and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the farther ſide of the Bed, was
buſtling a long time to put himſelf in order, while the
<hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> half diſtracted, riſes and pulls the Curtains
cloſe about her; which the Queen ſeeing, She calls out to her:
<hi>What</hi> Tomazo! <hi>You are reſolved then to keep the</hi> Count <hi>to
your Self this Night;</hi> and making to the Bed, She threw the Curtains again
open, and diſcovered <hi>Tomazo</hi> in a freſh Confuſion: By this time
the <hi>Count</hi> had gathered a little more aſſurance, and coming from
behind the Bed, he ſtrait threw himſelf at <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s Feet,
humbly ask'd her Pardon, and told her, he hop'd ſhe was not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the fatal miſtake he had like to have fallen in; and conſequently, he
doubted not of her favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; he was ſorry he had firſt

his Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Queen, who upon a juſt conſideration of the
Circumſtances, was ſufficiently ſatisfied of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, was ſo far
from being angry or diſturb'd, that after two or three ſits of Laughter,
She threw her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Arms about his Neck, and with Ten Thouſand
Kiſſes Seal'd his Pardon: then turning to her dear <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi> She
would Laugh, and ſay, Make haſt my Dear <hi>Antonio,</hi> make haſte; O

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106649:40"/>putting her in mind of the time of
the Night, they were retiring to the Cloſet to Converſe, when a
Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> comes in haſte, to give an account
of an Expreſs, <hi>Lycogenes</hi> had receiv'd from the <hi>Belgian
Lowlands,</hi> giving an Account of the Preparations and Deſigns of the
Prince <hi>Anaximander,</hi> to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the Grievances of the poor
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Albion:</hi> the Queen (who was no otherwiſe
read in the Politicks and Affairs of State, than as Father <hi>Pedro,</hi> the
<hi>Count,</hi> or ſome other of her Prieſts upon particular occaſions
had Inſtructed her) was not at firſt ſo apprehenſive of the Danger as
the <hi>Count,</hi> who was ſo vehemently ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the News, that
without any more Complement than Bowing to the Queen, he deſcends and takes
Coach for <hi>Alba Regalis;</hi> where he was no ſooner Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, but he
ſound the whole Court Alarm'd; and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes</hi> in Solemn Council was
gone to Debate the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: The next Day the News was confirmed by
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expreſs, and then all was in an Uproar; <hi>Lycogenes</hi> in a
great Fright comes to Council, tells them his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of
<hi>Anaximanders</hi> Deſign, requires their beſt and ſpeedy Advice, puts
them in Mind of all the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he had made in the Laws for their Sakes; and
that now, without ſpeedy Aſſiſtance, he was likely to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, and
the <hi>Pagans</hi> Hopes throughout <hi>Albion</hi> to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt.
Such dreadful Words as theſe, and coming from a Prince that had been in every
<hi>Panegyrick</hi> cry'd up and applauded for his Conſtancy of Mind, and
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage, did ſo amaze and terrifie his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, that they
could not in a long time ſet their Hearts on any ſerious Conſultation;
ſome of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, then in again; preſently others that had been
abſent, came Poſting to underſtand and enquire into the Buſineſs;
ſome would relate it as terrible as their Fears, and repreſent the numbers
of the Princes Ships and Men double; here you ſhould ſee a haughty
Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106649:41"/>Prieſt, come humbly fawning to a Chriſtian
Noble, as if confeſſing paſt Miſ-carriages and Crimes, he wiſh'd for
good Conditions: Some would be pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Goods and Treaſure, their
guilty boading Conſciences fore-telling their forc'd Flight and Ruine: But
<hi>Pedro</hi> and <hi>Poliorchetes,</hi> the Chancellour, who were
ſenſible they were likely to ſhare the ſum and ſubſtance of all
unhappy Revolutions, thought it now no longer time to dally, or ſpend the
precious Minutes in uſeleſs idle Fears, but to apply the moſt healing
Medicines, that the preſent bleeding Wound would bear; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
perſwade <hi>Lycogenes</hi> to re-call ſeveral Edicts, that by their
Inſtigation and Council had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd againſt the Intereſt and
Safety of his Chriſtian Subjects: And Father <hi>Pedro</hi> calling a
Convocation of his Inferiour Prieſts, makes them Diſ-robe, and in
diſguiſe to mingle among the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, in the <hi>Forum,
Burſe,</hi> Temples, and other publick Meeting-Places, and there with
Confidence to utter falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to leſſen the Strength of
<hi>Anaximander,</hi> to cry up the miſeries of a Civil War, to Extol the
Loyalty of the King's Chriſtian Subjects, to make compariſon between young
<hi>Perkin's</hi> Expedition and this, and thence to conclude poſitively of
the like ſucceſs: The Court party alſo of Renegado Chriſtian Divines,
were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Preach up the neceſſity of Obedience and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to
withſtand the Prince in his Attempts, and to brand his Expedition with the
horrible Title of <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Theſe, and many other Arts were
uſed to take off the Edge of <hi>Anaximander</hi>'s Sword; ſometimes they'd
Brand His Royal Perſon with baſe and ignominious Names; other times they
would think to terrifie the Rebels (as they would call all that ſhould
aſſiſt him) with the Exemplary Puniſhments, inflicted by the
Chancellour <hi>Polyorchetes,</hi> in his bloody <hi>Weſtern Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne:</hi>
But all would not do, the Chriſtians knew the<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106649:41"/>
                     <hi>Pagan</hi> Punick Faith, as well as Inhumane Cruelty, they ſaw
their Laws, their Liberties, and Lives at Stake; and that now was the only time
to aſſert and recover them; the <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts had often mock'd
the King out of his moſt Solemn Promiſes, and <hi>Meſſalina</hi> had
endeavoured to entail their Slavery upon them to all Poſterity. Nothing
therefore could ſtagger their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reſolutions, but like the Adder, they
were Deaf to all their treacherous Charms, and falſe Inſinuations:
Notwithſtanding, <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s dauntleſs Pride could not 'till
the Princes Landing ſtoop to the apprehenſion of any material Danger;
ſhe'd often chalk out time and place to ſee the ſend weak Prince brought
bound to <hi>Troynovant;</hi> She'd Laugh and Jeer at his few puny For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and
would in every Table Talk defeat his whole Battalions; ſometimes She'd call
her Melancholy Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe deeper apprehenſions, now had chang'd his
uſual Mirth; ſometimes, I ſay, She'd call him to her, and reproach his
needleſs Fears: <hi>What?</hi> would She ſay, <hi>Can</hi> Davila
<hi>ſuſpect or fear, when</hi> Meſſalina<hi>'s Heart is free? Can thy
ſo much applauded Courage ſtoop to what a poor weak Womans Soul can
ſtand? Stand did I ſay? By all that's good, this Hand ſhall bow the Neck
of that poor Spirited Prince, that weak preſumptuous Wretch, that dare Invade
my Husbands lofty Crown: What my Dear</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila, <hi>canſt thou lament?
Haſt thou a Diadem to looſe, a Throne to be pull'd down, Subjects and
Slaves to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thy Face? Theſe may create a Monarchs doubts
and fears: What then ſhould thy Eyes ſwell with needleſs Tears? Remit,
remit, alas, thy uſeleſs apprehenſions! I ſure am the Center of thy
Thoughts: In me thy utmoſt Wiſhes are determined; while then I ſtand
ſecure, What need'ſt thou fear? Chear up, chear up, my dear lov'd</hi>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106649:42"/>The <hi>Count</hi> both wondred and rejoyced
at the great Heroick Heart of his beloved Royal Miſtreſs; and tho' he knew,
and was perfectly ſenſible that her words were rather the effect of her
dauntleſs Spirit, than of a ſolid Conſideration; yet he ſaw ſo much
Love expreſs'd in her frequent concernment for him, that he could not but in
common Gratitude and Honour, make her the ſame, or ſuitable returns; he
therefore told her Majeſty, That his apprehenſion of being ſeparated from
her, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, a ſenſible affliction to him; but above all he
deplor'd his great unhappineſs, in not being able to afford more than his own
perſonal aſſiſtance, to repell her own, and their great Prophet's
Enemies; that he cordially wiſh'd the Prince <hi>Anaximander</hi>'s
undertakings might prove as frivilous and ineffectual, as ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them; that his great care of her Majeſty's Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Honour, was the only
Foundation of his Fear; that he did indeed object the worſt to himſelf, but
did not believe he had yet any reaſon to diſpair of the beſt; that he was
ſenſible her ſuper-eminent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had render'd her Obnoxious to the
Slanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and envy of the Wicked Chriſtian <hi>Albionites;</hi>
that the King her Husband's Zeal, in a good and pious Cauſe, had incurred the
wicked Malice of his rebellious Subjects; and that if his Affairs (which Heaven
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) ſhould happen to fail, it would be the total ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and
deſtruction of his Life and happineſs, to think ſhe ſhould fall into
the Hands of her Enemies, or be leſſened in her Fortune or high Station;
that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was his humble and hearty requeſt, that ſhe would
ſuffer himſelf, and ſome other ſelect Friends, to conſult and lay
before her ſuch meaſures for the ſecurity of her Perſon and Honour, as
ſhould appear to be moſt convenient; that providing againſt the worſt,
would be no hindrance of her enjoyment of the beſt; but above all, that ſhe
would give him her reſolution and firm<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106649:42"/>promiſe to let
himſelf accompany and wait on her in all, and every Misfortune that
poſſibly could befal her. <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalina</hi> was raviſh'd with this
ſo zealous and tender de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of her Dear Counts Love, and in a
loving tranſport catching his Hand and Arm, ſhe pull'd him to her on a
Couch whereon ſhe ſate, where with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Raptures ſhe would
Circle her Snowy Arms and Hands, about his Neck and Waſt; Oh! how ſhe'd
ſuck his Amorous ruddy Lipps and Checks, and with her Balmy melting Hand
ſtroak, and preſs, and play with his Manly Neck, and Face,
<q rend="inline">"Oh! could'ſt thou think Dear Cruel Heart,

No, no, my Life, my <hi>Davila,</hi> continued ſhe:

Slumber. Faithful <hi>Tomaſo,</hi> in the mean time was hovering about the
Out-Guards to prevent ſurprize, and to divert the acceſs of any
ſuſpitious Perſons: She had waited half an hour or little more, when
comes a Meſſenger from King <hi>Lycogenes</hi> to <hi>Meſſalina,</hi>
which brought account, the <hi>Prince</hi> was now at <hi>Sea,</hi> and with a
numerous Fleet was making all the Sail he could for <hi>Albion:</hi> the
<hi>Marchioneſs</hi> receives the Meſſage, and all in Tears repairs with

alarm's the <hi>Count; Anaximander</hi> comes, Dread Soveraign cries the

all? O Mighty Operations! the Count who had hardly yet recovered himſelf, was
look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about when he had heard the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> declare he was

ſhould'ſt thou nip theſe daring Chriſtians hopes, and with one happy
blow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our <hi>Pagan</hi> Friends and Intereſt for ever. In the mean
time <hi>Lycogenes</hi> in late and early Councels, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving how to
ſtop this overflowing Current of the <hi>Princes</hi> deſigns; he had
obſerv'd an unuſual blithneſs in all his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nobles
Faces, and was ſenſible that the Prince <hi>Anaximander</hi> could not
preſume to attack the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bionites,</hi> without very good Incouragement
from the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee's: however, with all his induſtry he was not able to learn

<hi>Pedro</hi> and others of his <hi>Anti-Chriſtian</hi> Councel were
adviſing him to lay hold on, and ſecure all that he could but in the

more than the preſent Circumſtances of affairs could bear; others

'twas thought adviſable to ſecure the <hi>Citadel,</hi> in ſome Peculiar

the arrival of their great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer: and ſeveral with Boats ſtock'd with
freſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion put off and diſpers'd them about the Fleet, for the
refreſhment of the Seamen and Souldiers, and having provided before ſmall
Bridges and other conveniencies for the Landing his Army, and his Carriages, he
found<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106649:44"/>himſelf in a condition within three days to draw up
and muſter his Men, who had by this time heartily recovered the Fatigue of
their Voyage. <hi>Lycogenes</hi> in the mean time, though very much dejected,
had taken care to Levy a Gallant Army, and it was one while thought a very
doubtful thing, to which, to aſcribe the Victory. <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> had
not brought with him above Fourteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe and Foot, but thoſe
indeed Experienc'd <hi>Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane Bands,</hi> very Compleatly Arm'd; beſides,
<hi>Lycogenes</hi> before the Prince landed, had at leaſt Thirty Thouſand
well appointed Souldiers, ſo that when he began tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly to compute his
own ſtrength, and his Enemies weakneſs, he thought to take heart, and
reſolv'd for the greater Incouragement of his Men to appear at the head of
them himſelf, and withal ſpeed to give his Enemies Battle, and hinder their
further Progreſs into the Country; but alas, while he was flatter'd and
amus'd with the ſtrength and bravery of his own Army, <hi>Anaximander</hi>
was muſtering and entertaining the Choice Young Men of all the
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the People conſidering the Cauſe, and
that their Liberties and Lives, were now their only laſt ſtake, they came
flocking in ſo faſt to the Prince, that he had in eight days more
Subſtantial choice Men than he could handſomely make uſe of; beſides,
the Major part of <hi>Lycogenes</hi> his Army, being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
they could not but be ſenſible that thoſe Swords that they ſhould draw
againſt their Brethren in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> would at the long run be
employ'd againſt their own Throats and Lives; and therefore, being already
weary of ſubmitting their Free-Born Souls to the Bondage and Tyranny of their
<hi>Pagan</hi> Officers, they aſſociate and take Council to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether how to
free themſelves and their Country, by either, laying down their Arms, or
going over to the Prince <hi>Anaximander,</hi> and now the fatal Period of
<hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes</hi> his Reign drew near, for firſt whole Companies, Troops,
and Regiments of his Army revolt from him, and<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106649:44"/>then his
Friends and Near Relations, touch'd with the ſence of deeper obligations due
to their Country, their Religion and their God: Thus the Trump being turned,
the <hi>Pagans</hi> quickly find their diſadvantage of the Game, and in
Confuſion, like diſtracted Men fling up their Cards, and ſcamper to
ſecure themſelves from payment. <hi>Meſſalina</hi> alſo to her Sorrow
ſees what hitherto ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would believe; now <hi>Pedro</hi> finds the
fallacy of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, while <hi>Polyorchetes, Sunderania,</hi> and
others of that wicked Grue curſe their unlucky Stars, and ſeek in every
corner for ſome place of refuge: Poor <hi>Lycogenes</hi> flies in confuſion
from his diſtant Foes, not able to endure even the report of their approach:
He that like another <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſaw himſelf begirt even with a world
of Guards, now flies bereft almoſt of neceſſary Attendance: He no
ſooner arriv'd at his old Pallace of <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> but in haſt he
calls a Secret and Solemn Council of all his few remaining Friends, and after
ſuch Debates as the time would afford and permit, they reſolve to ſend
propoſals to the Prince, who like a Swelling Tide had now o're ſpread the
Country; and the danger being grown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond recovery, <hi>Meſſalina,</hi>
at laſt thinks it high time to prepare for her retirement, and with all
ſpeed provide for her Security; the Young Child alſo by the advice of the
Council was to be nicely taken care of, being likely to prove a very good after
Game. The Queen therefore immediatly ſends for the <hi>Count</hi> to a
private Conference, who as greedily comes, in hopes to perſwade her to a
ſpeedy Flight: Juſt as he approach'd the Cloſet Door, the Queen all in
tears gets up, and not being able for a while to ſpeak, leans on his Neck,
and after many grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sobs and heavy Sighs, falls Fainting in his Arms: never
was Lover in ſo ſad diſtreſs as was the <hi>Count</hi> at this unhappy
accident; call out he dare not, for fear of any Suſpition or ill
interpretation of his being with the Queen alone; to go and leave her Dying as
he thought, his<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106649:45"/>Soul could ne're agree to; how to
aſſiſt, what remedy to uſe, where to get any thing to apply he knew
not: diſtracted thus he Tore himſelf, and Rav'd, and Curſt his
misfortune, then would he kneel by the Couch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had laid her, and
kiſs, and ſigh, and Pray, and call, till at laſt the Queen coming to her
ſelf open'd her dying Eyes, and caſting a Languiſhing look at her Dear
<hi>Count,</hi> who was now in a bitter Agony of Sorrow, and hardly able to
ſupport his oppreſſed Spirits, ſhe rais'd her ſelf a little on the
Couch, and in a Sorrowful manner lifting up her Hands and Eyes, recounts a
freſh the ſum of her Misfortunes: All, all, is loſt, Dear
<hi>Davila,</hi> ſaid ſhe, my Hopes, my Peace, my Joy, my Glories, my All.
And if I have ought left me worth the Thought of Life, it is, that I enjoy thy
Love. That Coronet's my own, though my Crown's loſt. <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
is now driven to the Fatal Period of her Grandure in <hi>Albion,</hi> a ſhock
ſo diſmal, that the Agonies of ſuch a Fall, to ſuch Soaring Ambitition
as <hi>Meſalina</hi>'s, are only to be conceived by thoſe that feel them.
In her fit of Deſparation (for 'twas almoſt come to that) ſhe is Mrs.
however of Reaſon enough ſtill to provide at leaſt againſt the Worſt
of ſhames, and Laſt of Miſeries, her falling into her Enemies Hands, the
<hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> a Danger at that Time much threatned; the united
Murmurs of <hi>Albion</hi> looking up to no other Fountain, and Original of the
Woes and Calamities, of the Pittyed and Deplored <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> then the
Hot Counſels, or rather Inchantments of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> and her
<hi>Pagan</hi> Abettors. And how heavy the weight of ſuch an
<hi>Inquiſition</hi> would fall, even her Flatterers are but too
ſenſible. Her Flight therefore, being now the laſt Plank ſhe has to lay
hold off to ſcape ſinking, ſhe prepares a ſmall Diminitive Yatcht, and
hires (command ſhe could not, ſo feeble is Soveraignty without Hearts) a
handful of Select Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all well bribed, and well ſworn, privately, to
waft her ſafe to <hi>Gothland,</hi> the only Sanctuary. (Such
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106649:45"/>Univerſal Enemies had her Politicks pull'd down) the
World could yield her. Oh Zeal, Zeal, mad Zeal! what Humane Diſtreſſes,
Miſeries, Ruines are Thine, and Thy only Creation?—Nay, is there
ſcarce that one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration, that ever ſet whole Nations in a Flame,
that has not been lighted by a Cole from an Altar? Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Meſſalina,</hi> and deſervedly ſo, the late Royal Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to no
leſs than <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Soveraign, the Oceans Lord, and the ſtill
Terror of the World, had not Zeal, Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, Deſtroying, Dethroning Zeal,
blazed out; Poor miſguided, deluded, hard-fated <hi>Lycogenes!</hi> This very
<hi>Meſſalina,</hi> of all thoſe Floating Caſtles, the late attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pageants of her Triumph, all thoſe once Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Famed Walls of
<hi>Albion;</hi> left Miſtriſs of no more than a poor Cock-boat! Inſtead
of glittering Flaggs, and flowing Streamers, uſhered by all the
<hi>Tritons</hi> of the <hi>Main,</hi> and as She paſt, Saluted by all the
Ecchoing Thunder from the Shoar; now to Steal away by Night, Skulk like a
Fugitive, obſcured by Shades and Coverts! Yes, Deſtiny and Zeal have ſo
Decreed it! For Sea therefore (ſuch her Equippment, and ſuch the
haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cauſe that call'd her) She prepares; and takes with her, her
<hi>Tomazo, Sunderania,</hi> Count <hi>Davila, Sebaſtian,</hi> and
<hi>Pedro,</hi> and ſome others of her Cabinet Friends; the laſt Three only
being a little Transformed, by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes of Buff, Scarlet and Feather,
metamorphoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to down-right Militants: For indeed her Eccleſiaſtick
Confidents, eſpecially Father <hi>Pedro,</hi> were grown ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
Infamous, that they durſt not truſt themſelves in their own Shapes, even
with Sworn Hirelings and Mercenaries; not Gold it ſelf being ſufficient to
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Truſt or Safety. The Queen had but very little left, to ſave
and carry with her, except her Jewels; for truly in ſpight of all that good
Husbandry, that eminent and ſingular good Quality in <hi>Lycogenes;</hi> yet
what with Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Armies, and no Taxes (for he neither lov'd or pleaſ'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106649:46"/>Senates enough, for any new Donations from them) and from
the continual daily Dreine, he received from thoſe innumerable Spiritual
Horſe-leeches, that hung upon his Purſe-ſtrings, his Exchequer was but
low. <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s Jewels therefore, being all the Treaſure ſhe
could ſave; thoſe by Father <hi>Pedro</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Advice, were
committed to the Charge and Cuſtody of an <hi>Italian</hi> Prieſt,
recommended to her by him, as a Heavenly minded man, a Recluſe from the
World, and who as a Perſon under a Vow of Poverty, of a Character and
Profeſſion above any Temptation, was the only man ſhe could beſt
repoſe that Truſt in. Thus Embarqued, with their beſt Sails to their
ſmall Frigat; with a Fair Wind, and Proſperous Gale, they arrive at
<hi>Gothland:</hi> for indeed the juſt Ordaining Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that had puniſht
her with the loſs of a Crown, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo heavy a Wreck at Land, thought fit
to bound their Indignation there.</p>
                  <p>From her Arrival in <hi>Gothland,</hi> the Scene begins a little
to Change: For the <hi>Pagans</hi> there, with no ſmall Homage and Adoration,
reſound her Welcome. The Entertainment ſhe received, as peculiarly
influenc'd by the Commands of <hi>Polydorus,</hi> was every where Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and
Magnificent: I dare not call it his Bounty, or Generoſity. For truly, all the
utmoſt Services, Reſpect, Obligations, Protections, or Aſſiſtance;
and indeed, all, and more then <hi>Polydorus</hi> has, or can do for
<hi>Lycogenes,</hi> or <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> ſo near a part of him; are but
poor and faint Returns, to compenſate thoſe Miſeries and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in
which his own private Leagues and Cabals, and the too prevailing
<hi>Gallick</hi> Councels and Meaſures in <hi>Albion,</hi> have involved the
ruined <hi>Lycogenes.</hi> With a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Train of Perſons of the Higheſt
Quality, and a Band of Guards, a truly Royal Retinue, is <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
Conducted to the <hi>Gothick</hi> Court; whilſt <hi>Polydorus</hi> himſelf,
with that ſolemn State and Grandeur, comes to meet her, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106649:46"/>Congratulate her Arrival; paying her all that Humble and
Profound Reſpect, and Awful Attendance, as if ſhe came nor from Quitting,
but to the Poſſeſſing of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem: So Pompous was her Entry, that
ſcarce an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Roman Triumph could exceed it. And indeed ſhe came to
Triumph, the very firſt Sally of her Eye, bringing her back no leſs a
Trophy, than the Heart of <hi>Polydorus.</hi> To give her her Right, even
without Flattery; never was Conqueſt ſo Expeditious: No ſooner was the
very Lightning ſeen, but the Bolt had Executed. So Daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were her Charms,
to the ſurpriſed <hi>Polydorus,</hi> that he truly dated his intire
Vaſſallage, from the firſt Moment he ſaw her. His once Adored Dear
Veſtal Divinity, or his Haughtier <hi>Montezania</hi>'s Charms, were nothing
to the Influence of <hi>Meſſalina:</hi> ſo unaccountable is the Archery
of the Blind God: For <hi>Meſſalina</hi> had been no Stranger to
<hi>Polydorus:</hi> when before her Marriage with <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> in her
Travel from her own <hi>Italick</hi> Dutchy, to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
<hi>Albion,</hi> ſhe took the Court of <hi>Polydorus</hi> in her way; yet,
then her Beauties, though in their Younger Bloom, could be beheld without half
the preſent Fatality. For, whether his then Regnant Veſtal Mrs had ſo
fill'd his Soul, as had left no Room for any other Gueſt, or for what
Reaſon elſe; a common Veneration was all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering he made her then;
when Sighing, Deſiring, Languiſhing, Dying, whole Hecatombs are all too
little Sacrifices now. In fine, ſo Capricious an Aſcendant had his
preſent Governing Planets, that that very <hi>Polydorus</hi> fated for the
Dethroning of the Unfortunate <hi>Lycogenes;</hi> the ſame
<hi>Matchivilian</hi> Part, before Practiſed againſt his Crown, muſt now
be Acted againſt his Bed. For from this Hour, Friendſhip, Honour,
Hoſpitality, (Obligations not the firſt time diſpenſed withal by
<hi>Polydorus</hi>) and all other ties quite cancell'd; the Poſſeſſion
of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> though at the price of a Kingdom, is his whole and
ſole Ambition. For <hi>Meſſalina</hi> he Burns, and were her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106649:47"/>Virtue a Rock of Ice, (which for ought he knows it may be);
for though indeed he was no Stranger to all other her Intrigues and Affairs,
however in her Curtain <hi>Arcana,</hi> her Amours, he was no Cabinet
Counſellour) he reſolves to melt it down; and that ſo far from a
ſcruple at the Undertaking, that he ſhould account it not only the
ſweeteſt, but the moſt glorious of all his Atchievements. For ſetting
all other Conſiderations apart, what <hi>Polydorus</hi> once but will'd, he
could not will unjuſtly; his Ambition was Commiſſion'd of his
Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence's High Chancellour, whilſt to Deſire was to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; and
whatever but once Determined, took the immediate Stamp of Right and Equity to
paſs it into an irrevocable Decretal; inſomuch, that the very Dethroning of
a God, if once thought practicable, to deſire it was enough to render it
juſtifiable.</p>
                  <p>As there wanted no Magnificence in all her Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment from
her firſt Landing, even before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the enamour'd
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> you may imagine no exceſſes of the higheſt ſtudied
Gallantry were omitted now. The Adored <hi>Meſſalina</hi> is Lodged in a
Pallace ſo Glorious, as might have fitted the Reception of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> in all her Pride; and which her <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the then
Competitor for Univerſal Empire, and in all that Love that loſt him the
World for her, could not have furniſh'd out more rich and Splendid: Nor did
the Brightneſs and Richneſs of her Pallace conſiſt only in the
outſide Wealth and Beauty of her Shining Beds, Embroidered Canopys, the
richeſt of Tapiſtries, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets, Seruitores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The unſeen
Treaſures, outvy'd the glittering Frontiſpiece: In this Drawer of a Cabinet
Fourty, 'tother Fifty, a Third a Hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Thouſand Pieces of Gold; a Fourth,
Lockets of Diamonds, a Fifth, Ropes of Pearl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all too mean
a Tribute to his Soveraign <hi>Meſſalina.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106649:47"/>now we talk of Pearl and Diamonds, her own Cargo of Jewels,
committed to the true and truſty <hi>Italian</hi> Prieſt aforeſaid, were
under Suſpition of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; both the Treaſure and the Treaſurer
being at preſent Inviſible: We dare not ſurmize ſo unkindly, that
Avarice, or filthy Worldly Lucre, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon ſo Sanctify'd a
Recluſe from the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a particular Vow of Poverty; and above all,
thought worthy (as we told you) of the peculiar recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Father
<hi>Pedro,</hi> could make <hi>Him</hi> tardy in ſuch a Caſe. But whether,
on the more charitable ſide, by ſome impulſe of Religion he reſerv'd
them for Holy &amp; Pious Uſes; as to preſent them to the Shrine of the
<hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettian</hi> Diana, to implore from her Coeleſtial Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, her
<hi>Albion Majeſties</hi> Conception of a Duke of <hi>Eborac,</hi> to her
Prince of <hi>Cambria;</hi> or for any other like Dedication to Holy Mother
Church, ſo it is, that he was no ſooner gotten on Shoar, but modeſt good
Man, he withdrew, and was never ſeen after it. And notwithſtanding
<hi>Polydorus</hi> publiſh'd an Edict, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing a very ample Reward to
that Perſon that ſhould find him, and recall the Wanderer: Either his
Divine Contemplations, and ſublimer Meditations, had rapt him above the
liſtening to humane and mundane Proclamations; or elſe his Devout
Pilgrimage had carryed him beyond the hearing of them, ſo that his Recallment
is utterly Deſpaired of; inſomuch, that unleſs her <hi>Albion
Majeſty</hi> be content to take out their Price in <hi>Dirges</hi> for her
Soul, 'tis thought for any other Reſtitution or Payment, ſhe now hopes but
little. <hi>Polydorus</hi> now begins his approach to <hi>Meſſalina,</hi>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving an immediate vigorous Siege, with all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he can bring to
lye down before her: His dayly Viſits, Obſervance, and conſtant
Attendance, which at firſt carried onely the Face of common Gallantry,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106649:48"/>and look'd upon by all Eyes as no other than the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Treatment of a Royal Hoſpitality to Greatneſs in Diſtreſs, and under
his Protection; are now both by his Looks, Behaviour, and Addreſs, ſo
Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly managed, that <hi>Meſſalina</hi> (unleſs ſhe wanted
Eyes) muſt find that in the Aſſiduous <hi>Polydorus,</hi> there was
ſomething more then a kind Hoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> an Adoring Slave.</p>
                  <p>The Queen now fully ſatisfied how great a Vaſſal her Eyes
had won her, begins to conſider the Wiſe Management of ſo Important a
Conqueſt. <hi>Polydorus</hi>'s Addreſs and Perſonage, even abſtracted
from his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Character, and the Luſter of a Crown, were ſuch as
always ſtood fair in the Female Eyes, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Heart no
diſ-acceptable Preſent to the very Proudeſt and moſt Diſdainful
Beauty. And our <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalina</hi> who was neither the Coyeſt, or moſt
In-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her Sex, already felt a Commiſeration about her, that
told her the Sighs of ſo Royal a Languiſher muſt not go unpittied. Time,

ſhe plainly foreſaw, would at laſt inevitably prevail; and therefore
fancying it no leſs then the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Ordainment of her Fate, ſhe has no
farther Thought then an entire Reſignation to Immutable Decree. However,
though the Stake muſt at laſt be loſt, yet the Playing her Game out
Politickly, and managing her Cards to her beſt Advantage, are in her own
Choice and Power. Yes, that, and that onely takes up all the buſineſs of
her waking, and indeed ſleeping Thoughts. The Terms and Conditions of a
Surrender; What Parly and Capitulations firſt; what Reſolution and
Obſtinacy (for the Victory muſt not be Cheap) ſhe muſt hold out with,
before the White Flag is at laſt to be hung out. Her Meditations on this
ſubject had one Evening led her alone from all<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106649:48"/>Company
into an Inner and Private Walk of the Garden; When <hi>Polydorus,</hi> whoſe
unreſting Soul had led his Body abroad too with much the ſame
Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, fortunately meets her. This opportunity as it gave him the
Bleſſing of a more Private Interview, then before he had met, ſo it
inſpired him with the Courage of making a more ample and particular
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Love, then all his hitherto fainter and diſtant
Addreſſes had made. Accordingly throwing himſelf at her Feet, in the
Tendereſt and moſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Expreſſions (the never wanted
Eloquence of Love) he told her how intirely the Soul of <hi>Polydorus</hi> was
ſubjected to the Eyes of <hi>Meſſalina:</hi> Nor did he more heighten the
Progreſs of her Victories, &amp; Power of her Charms, then the Fatality of
them; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Return of Pity his Death was Inevitable, whilſt his
Peace, Happineſs and Life were abſolutely in her Hands. The Queen, whoſe
part was now to Play, with a ſeeming Amazement, rather than a liſtening
At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, gave him the Liberty of finiſhing his whole Declaration; when as
Wakeing from a Frightful Dream, or Starting from a diſturbing Viſion,

quit the Siege yet. Accordingly not a day, nor ſcarce an hour paſſes that
he does not Viſit, Court, Sue, Plead, and ſpight of all Denials, all her
Pleas of Virtue and Chaſtity, that Mountain Honour ſhall not block his way.
Sometimes he Woes her with the Promis'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of her <hi>Albion,</hi>
the Re-inſtating her in all her former Grandeur; and if the Crown of
<hi>Albion</hi> will not purchaſe a Smile, he'll throw his own in, to make up
the Sum. In ſhort, No Gallantry, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; no Proteſtations, Vows or
Oaths, though ne'er ſo Extravagant, are wanting to purſue the Coy
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful <hi>Meſſalina:</hi> till one Morning in her Walk in the

<hi>Meſſalina</hi> thinks ſhe has now held out long enough to yield with
Honour: For after his Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Proteſtations of the Crowns and Scepters he
would lay at her Feet, and the Vaſſal World he would make her Miſtreſs
of; He told her, <hi>If Meſſalina would but Condeſcend to Crown his Love,
he would pay his<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106649:50"/>Acknowledgment of ſo Divine a
Bleſſing, with no leſs a Sacrifice then a hundred thouſand Chriſtian

Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Merit! An Offering of that price enough to Court a Saint, and
Win a Goddeſs.</hi> Such Eloquence is irreſiſtable; nay, the name of
ſuch a Sacrifice ſo pleaſed her, that had the ſtrongeſt Bonds of
<hi>Conſcience</hi> held her, that ſingle Thought had burſt the Feeble
Manacle; and the offering of ſo much Heretick ſtreaming Blood, were ſuch
an Atonement, as would not only expiate but conſecrate the very Sin it
ſelf. So pleaſed and ſo conquer'd, ſhe generouſly tells the
Raviſh'd <hi>Polydorus, That ſhe will expect him at Veſper-time, when
ſhe will ſend all her Retinue to the Moſque to their Devotion, and Attend

our Royal Lover to all his Furious Longings, Impatient Expectings, and

the Leading Cavalcade to the Coronation of Love: My Reader muſt be intreated
to interrupt his Expectation of the ſucceſs of this Grand Scene of our two

ſome Guards in the outer Rooms, are always left alone; and if your
Lordſhips Intentions are Honeſt and Virtuous (as I truſt in Heaven, they
are,) if you have any thing more to talk to me, you may come then and
welcome.</hi> The Happy Monſeigneur at this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and cunning
Aſſignation made by his kind <hi>Lactilla,</hi> (for there never wants
Womans Wit even in Simplicity it ſelf on ſuch an occaſion) felt a Delight
Anſwerable to the ſatisfaction ſo acceptable a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute would give him,
and reſolving to Return at the appointed Hour with that deſired Honeſty
and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as ſhould be beſt agreeable to her, leaves his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel in a
Kiſs, and Whiſpers in her Ear, that ſhe ſhould find him a Man of
Honour; and ſo Retires, and falls in with the Ladies in the Balcone. The poor
Nurſe waiting for the Veſpers, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the firſt time that
ever ſhe had a kindneſs for the Pagan Worſhip before) found her
Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little baulkt, when the Queen pretending In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
refuſed to go to Prayers; at which the Ladies likewiſe in Complaiſance to
her Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to go neither, but ſtay and pay their
At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to the Queen; which the Queen abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid, Commanding them
all to go to Prayers, and leave her onely to her Nurſe till their Return. The
Ladies accordingly Retiring; at their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Queen inſtead of
Staying in the Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the Child and Nurſe, bid <hi>Lactilla</hi>
have a Care of the Prince, for ſhe had occaſions to Retire into her
Cloſet, where ſhe would not be diſturb'd. This gave <hi>Lactilla</hi>
ſome little hopes again; for the Cloſet being on the farther ſide of a
large Room of State lying beyond the Bed-Chamber, ſhe fancied
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106649:58"/>her dear Lord might gain Acceſs without any Baulk, at
that Diſtance and Retirement, from any thing of the Queens Interruption of
them. No ſooner was the Queen got into the Cloſet, but <hi>Count
Davilah,</hi> having received a Packet from <hi>Albion</hi> juſt at the
Chappel Door, defers his Devotion, and finding matter of Importance in it,
together with an incloſed Packet for <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> with Commands of
a Delivery at ſight, and with Orders of Immediate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the
Queen, about Affairs that required a ſpeedy Reſult; the <hi>Count</hi> in
purſuance of his Orders received, haſtes inſtantly to the Queen, and
deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her her Packet, together with the Inſtructions contain'd in his
own, requeſts her ſpeedy Conference. The Queen was much ſurprized at his
Approach, and in no ſmall <hi>Dilemma,</hi> for if ſhe diſmiſt him
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reading her Packet, and Conferring with him as deſired by the King
her Husband, ſhe ſhould be Guilty of a Fault highly againſt the Character
of that Reſpect and Duty ſhe ever paid him, and which in his preſent
Circumſtances would be an unpardonable neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; and if on the other ſide
ſhe ſtay'd in her Cloſet or Chamber to Read her Letters, and Debate their
Contents, ſhe was Jealous that the appointed Viſit of <hi>Polydorus</hi> at
ſo unſeaſonable an Hour as the Queens known Retirement, would give matter
of Suſpicion to the <hi>Count;</hi> and which beſides her unwillingneſs
to diſguſt a Perſon whom ſhe was not yet prepared to diſoblige and
quite break with, might thereby raiſe ſome Blemiſh upon her Reputation.
Between theſe two Conſiderations, with a ſuddain Preſence of Mind,
ſhe thought of this Expedient, which was to Invite the <hi>Count</hi> down
into the Garden, and there Diſpatch the Conference: whereupon ſhe deſired
him to Walk down with her; and as ſhe paſt by the Bed-Chamber,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106649:58"/>ſhe told the Nurſe whither and with whom ſhe was
going, and bid her expect her Return immediately. By this Projection ſhe
thought <hi>Polydorus</hi> coming in her abſence according to appointment,
and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her within, would undoubtedly ask the Nurſe for her, and
thereby informed, be Invited to ſtay, and Attend her Return.</p>
                  <p>At the Queens Departure it was juſt drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
Evening, being a little paſt Sun-ſet: And <hi>Lactilla</hi> extraordinarily
pleaſed to think ſhe ſhould have the whole Lodgings free, and by that
means, if her Lord kept Touch, enjoy all the Privacy and Freedom her Heart
could wiſh; being truly in her Nature a little more fearful, and ſomething
baſhfuller in an Amourous Tranſgreſſion, then the Fairer Court Sinners
generally more harden'd, and more Couragious at a Love Adventure, had already
drawn all the very Window Curtains of the Bed-Chamber cloſe, to be as much
Retired as poſſibly ſhe could.—Juſt as the Queen was got down the
Back-Stairs, Enters the King by the other Stairs, and immediately with all the
haſte of an Invited Lover makes to the Cloſet; but finding the Queen not
there, and imagining ſhe might be in the Bed-Chamber Trips as Nimbly thither.
The Nurſe hearing ſome body Walk croſs the Room of State, with that eager
pace that ſpoke him a Lover, as ſhe thought by his Tread; and not doubting
any other, but that her Dear Lord was come; in a kind of a Panick Fear, fitting
Perdue upon the Bed behind the Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

thinking it her turn to talk a little Amorouſly now; <hi>Well my dear

your poor</hi> Lactilla <hi>ſo hard-hearted as you have ſometimes told her
ſhe was, for if ſuch Love as mine</hi>—Lactilla!—cries
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> ſtarting up from the Bed, in a ſurprize ſo killing,
that not the Ghoſts and Spectres of all the Chriſtian Victims his own
Edicts had ever doom'd, or his Booted Diſciples executed; nay, nor all his
broken Leagues turn'd Goblins, could have Stagger'd him more. At firſt, in
the heighth of Agony and Bitterneſs of Soul, he thought 'twas a Trick of
<hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s; that his high-flown Ambition of attempting the Queen
of <hi>Albion</hi>'s Vertue, had put her Pride and Scorn upon this Stratagem of
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his Audacious Love by ſo contemptible and deſpicable a
Creature Foyſter'd upon him: Such Dirt and Rubbiſh in the Arms of
<hi>Polydorus!</hi> The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that thought, and his enraged
Sentiments of ſo unpardonable an Affront, could hardly with-hold him from
drawing his Sword and Executing his Fury, (though never ſo unmanly,) on the
Heart of that Sordid Engine and Tool, in this Inſolent manner made uſe of,
to abuſe him. But theſe ſuggeſtions were ſoon ſuppreſt by ſome
kinder thoughts of <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> it being impoſſible, as he
thought, for ſo Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Creature to be ſo great a Jilt, or rather
greater Devil, as this piece of Impoſture muſt render her. Beſides, were
ſhe all the Furies and Feinds of her whole Sex put together, yet, as a Woman
of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Quality, her very Character, if nothing elſe, would never
ſuffer her to make choice of this, of all the Revenges in the World, (if any
ſuch ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.) For whatever Stratagems a Great Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might
make uſe of to Gratifie her Spleen, Spight, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106649:60"/>Malice, Hate,
or any other Paſſion; ſhe would never turn Bawd for any of them. That
part of his Fear upon theſe Recollections being pretty well clear'd up, he
reſolved however to ſatisfie himſelf by ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories to
<hi>Lactilla</hi> (as much as he could make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovery of his
Perſon,) what Sorcery, Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Malicious Devil of Fortune had Snared
him into ſo poor a Nooſe as the Arms of <hi>Lactilla;</hi> a Thought that
ſo much Diſguſted his Haughty Pride, that he would not, for half the
Price of a Kingdom, be made ſo much the Jeſt of the World, as ſo Humble
and Courſe a Love Adventure, (he fancied) if it ſhould take Air, would
render him; more eſpecially if it ſhould get to the Ear of
<hi>Meſſalina;</hi> for his meer Indignation could never digeſt ſo
ſhameful a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that his Imperial Careſſes (though never ſo
innocently) ſhould be Debaſed to ſo Sordid an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. And therefore, if
for no other Reaſon, from Her above the reſt of the World he muſt
endeavour to ſtifle the Diſcovery of this Accurſed Accident: Turning then
to <hi>Lactilla,</hi> (who ſtill lay upon the Bed in no ſmall Surprize, and
as you may imagine, in no leſs trouble at her Dear Lords ſo abrupt and
unkind Start from her Arms.) <hi>Well, Dear</hi> Lactilla, ſays
<hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, I hope the Queen has no Suſpicion of our

Thouſand Pound! To be Burnt for Hereſie, or Hang'd for High Treaſon
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that little Princely Babe, would be the leaſt I muſt look for in
this Pagan Land. No, my Dear Lord, we poor Countrey Folks are not ſo dull
neither;<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106649:60"/>how ſimple ſoever we may be in other matters,
we have always Wit enough in our Loves: and if my Dear Lord can be kind to ſo
Worthleſs a Thing as I am; never fear Queens nor Empereſſes diſcovering
of us: let me alone to take care of that.</hi> This Innocent Anſwer of
<hi>Lactilla</hi>'s, (excepting the Reſentments of ſo Nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a
miſtake, and ſo unhappy a diſappointment, which he could not yet ſo
eaſily, Conquer) ſatisfied all the reſt of <hi>Polydorus</hi>
diſquiets; for now he plainly found, that the Nurſes miſtaking him for
the Lord <hi>Laforſe,</hi> had not onely diſpel'd all his firſt
ungenerous Suſpicions of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> (a Thought, which how
Momentary ſoever it laſted, he could now hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give himſelf for) by
convincing him, that not only Fortune was the true and only Jilt that had put
this Trick upon him; but alſo by Vertue of his ſtill paſſing for the
ſuppoſed <hi>Laforſe,</hi> together with the Favour of the Dark, he had
now an opportunity of Marching off utterly undiſcovered, and defying the
utmoſt Malice of his Stars themſelves to expoſe his ſhame. Without any
ſtay therefore, or any other parting Compliment, then <hi>Adieu Dear</hi>
Lactilla, <hi>I'le ſee thee again very ſpeedily,</hi> he Starts out of the
Chamber, and clapping the Door after him, leſt any of the Lights in the Room
of State ſhould give her ſo much as a glimpſe of his Back-ſide, he
bolts down the Back-Stairs with all the Expedition he could make. He was not
gotten three paces below the Foot of the Stairs, but <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
croſſing a Walk in the Garden popt juſt upon him, who by this time having
adjuſted matters, and diſpatcht the <hi>Count,</hi> was indeed with no
leſs haſte Returning to her Cloſet in Expectance of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydorus,</hi>
whoſe Expectation by this time ſhe might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have over
heighten'd; if not a little, tryed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But meeting him moving off in
ſuch haſte.<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106649:61"/>
                     <hi>My Lord the King, why ſo faſt? I
hope the Face of</hi> Meſſalina <hi>has nothing ſo Terrible in it, as to
fright you.</hi> The King, between Surprize and Confuſion, (occaſion'd by
the ſight of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> and the freſh Remembrance of his
unfortunate Adventure with the Nurſe, his own Conſciouſneſs of which,
though unknown to the World beſide, made him Redden with a Bluſh almoſt
Scarlet deep, though the growing Night partly conceal'd the diſcovery of it;)
what through the ſuddenneſs of this Encounter, and the perplexity of his
Thoughts, being not well provided with words to Anſwer her, was ſtudying
for a Reply, when the Queen continued; <hi>Well,</hi> Polydorus, <hi>I
ſuppoſe you found but dull Entertainment above, by your haſte in running
away; though if the Expectation of my Company had been worthy of one Minutes
long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Diſpenſation, and your patience not quite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, I had
return'd to tell you, that the Receipt of an Expreſs from</hi> Lycogenes,
<hi>brought me by</hi> Count Davilah, <hi>drew me ſome Minutes into the
Garden. The Contents of which requiring ſome ſhort Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between us,
I took him down thither for it, leſt your expected Viſit at that time, to a
prying Eye, or a cenſuring Thought, might have afforded matter of Surmiſe
to my diſadvantage. But that fear is now paſt, for I have given him ſuch
a Diſpatch as may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> Polydorus, <hi>that</hi> Meſſalina
<hi>cannot be guilty of forgetfulneſs</hi>—This obliging Language of
the Queen, as it could not but infinitely Charm the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> ſo it could not but as much diſtract him too. For to
tell her, he had been in her Apartment, and ſtay'd there for her not full a
Quarter of an hour, (for indeed his whole Ingreſs, Egreſs and Regreſs
from <hi>Lactilla,</hi> was an Execution of no more Minutes diſpatch,) and
that truly (let him<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106649:61"/>mince it in as fine words as he pleas'd)
he had not patience to wait longer, though for ſo Divine a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as
the Poſſeſſing of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> would be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
impardonable. And on the other ſide, to own the Truth of his Adventure, that
frighted him thence; that Thought was all Death and Hell, and not Wild Horſes
could draw him to ſo ſhameful a Confeſſion. In this diſtraction of
Thought, it came at laſt into his Head, to tell her, <hi>That if her
ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abſence at ſo bleſt an hour, and after ſo Solemn and
Generous an Engagement, that had ſo intirely fill'd his Heart, and taken up
every Faculty of his Soul, might run him into any Impatiences or Extravagances
worthy a Rebuke, as his not waiting longer for her Return, and his over-zealous
coming down in Queſt after her, might be; however, he hoped ſhe would
excuſe all Effects, how blameable ſoever, that had no other than the
Tranſport of her Charms, and his own Paſſion for their Cauſe.</hi> The
Queen made him an obliging Anſwer, and told him, <hi>She was very well
ſatisfied, the Fault that was, being of her own ſide. But ſince
interpoſing Buſineſs had made her lapſe ſome Minutes in her
Promiſe, however, ſhe would make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it, and if he pleaſed to
Return with her, as ſhe had Expedited her Husbands Expreſs, ſhe was now
at leiſure to liſten to any Expreſſes of</hi> Polydorus, <hi>and as
ready to Diſpatch them.</hi> At which, giving her Hand to <hi>Polydorus,</hi>
which he received with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Reverence, they Returned back again, the
King only Murmuring all the way to himſelf, to think what good
ſubſtantial Love he had lately Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally Laviſht, or rather thrown
away; and which in his preſent Payment might be ſomething wanted to make up
his Sum. But above all it grated his very Soul to think, that ſo Abject a

Abaſht, (for in ſuch Caſes the Failure is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their Sex) perceiving

to his, as if ſhe had reſolved to ſhew, that ſhe either did not, or
would not ſee his Diſorder; a Behaviour, which carryed not only Endearment
in it but Policy too. For to triumph over Weakneſs, and jocque or cajole an
unperforming Lover, as ſome fooliſh reſenting<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106649:62"/>Beauties
in ſuch diſappointments have done, has ſometimes been too well known, to

Aſſignation: Whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, an Unconcern or Endearing
Connivance at Frailty, has encouraged the Retreating Unſucceeding
Aſſailant, to Rally again, come on, new Storm, and Conquer.
<hi>Polydorus</hi> in all this ſtaggering Shock, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome
Reſtleſs Starts and Flings, and now and then a Murmuring rougher ſort of
Breathing betwixt a Sigh and a Groan, that ſpoke better for him, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not

like the firſt; a meer thin Airy Flaſh and ineffectual Fire.—At this
laſt Defeat he could hold no longer, but ſtarted from the Couch, and flew
into that Storm and Rage, Madneſs and half Deſperation, that no Execrations

towards the Bed-Chamber] and then turning towards the Queen.] <hi>Beaſt,
Monſter, Traytor as I am</hi>—The Queen [ſtopping him.] <hi>Nay, no
more my Lord, Wrong not your ſelf with theſe unjuſt Reproaches; what you
would call your Crime, perhaps I've reaſon to eſteem your Glory; perhaps
you Love me too well, and that has been the cauſe. Deſire ſometimes has
been foil'd even by Deſire; and Loving bauk'd by Love. Alas, my Lord, there
are Heavens even above Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it may be your Extaſie has rapt you above
your Paradice. And to recall your Peace, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ſo Vain, to
think my Charms have had that Power.</hi> Oh Royal Excellence (replyed
<hi>Polydorus</hi>) [Aſtoniſh'd at ſo Amazing a Kindneſs.] <hi>You are
ſo Divinely good, that to lay hold of ſuch Tranſcendent Grace to ſave
me, without Deſert, would but double my Damnation.</hi> At which he began to
launch out into ſuch bitter Reviling and Railing againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that
the Queen not knowing their true Cauſe, began to think of a new Style to
recover his Reaſon, and therefore was reſolved to Rally him into his right
Wits again. <hi>Well Sir, If this won't ſatisfy you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I have a new
Diſcovery will anſwer all. I have either Heard or Read ſomewhere (no
matter which) [Smilingly] of Enchantments uſed in this caſe. 'Tis not the
firſt time, that Malice, and the Malice of a Woman too (for ſuch they ſay
there are in the World) has made uſe of Spells to defeat the Expectation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106649:63"/>of Lovers; and the tying of a Magical Knot (as ſome
ſuch practice, you know not, may have been uſed upon you) and the
Winchcraft of an Ill-Tongue have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had that ſtrange Power.</hi>
Bewitcht by an Ill-Tongue, Madam! (replyed <hi>Polydorus</hi>) <hi>Oh Madam!
[Sighing] There went more then all Ill-Tongues (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Enchanteſs) to
the Bewitching of me.</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Knots too ſay you? <hi>A Plague of the
Knots I Tye! Oh that Sprightful, Confounded Witch, Hag, Forcereſs, Beaſt,
Bawd, Strumpet</hi>—[he had almoſt ſaid <hi>Lactilla</hi>]
<hi>Beaſt, Bawd, Strumpst!</hi> When <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> Interrupting
him, What <hi>Beaſt, Bawd?</hi> Fortune Madam, Fortune, (Recollecting
himſelf) <hi>that Jilt, that Cheat, that Harlot, that Impudent Harlot,</hi>
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, <hi>the ſpight of my Stars, and the Malice of the Gods, that envyed
my Immortal Happineſs, and in downright Gall, rank Gall, Hemlock, Wormwood,
Poiſon, have ranſakt Hell, and Muſter'd all the Imps of Lucifer to rob me
of my Bliſs.</hi>

                     </note>The Harange had went on, had not
<hi>Fornacos</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, a nimble Forerunner before the reſt of the
Zealots returned from their Devotion, giving them warning to retreat from the
Cloſſet, and the King to prepare himſelf for the appearance of a more
indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Viſitor, which with much ado he endeavour'd; though the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in his Face was not eaſily maſterable. The Court beginning to
fill ſoon after, <hi>Meſſalina</hi> produced, and Read her Expreſſes,
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Landing of her <hi>Lycogenes</hi> in one of the Ports of
<hi>Gothland,</hi> a piece of News not ungrateful to the whole Company, ſince
it brought them the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the ſpeedy Honour of ſo Royal a Gueſt

<hi>That ſhe had before communicated the Contents to</hi> Polydorus, <hi>to
which indeed ſhe was obliged to him for his pleaſant Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit.</hi> Yes
Madam, readily anſwered <hi>Polydorus, I came to obey your Commands, and the
Care and Application I ſhall make for a Reception ſuitable to the Majeſty
of</hi> Albion, <hi>ſhall Convince the World that the Bonds that have tied
the Hearts of</hi> Lycogenes <hi>and</hi> Polydorus <hi>are Eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Days after <hi>Lycogenes</hi> arrives, neither unlookt for,
neither welcome; for they knew he came to them like a Gameſter at an
Ordinary, that had loſt all his Money, and came for a new Recruit. By my
Soul, our <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> I have had ill Luck; but I'le Play t'other Game
for't. 'Tis ill venturing upon a Looſers Hand quoth <hi>Polydorus.</hi> Sir,
quoth <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> Lend me but t'other Threeſcore Touſand Pounds,
and you ſhall have all <hi>Ireland</hi> for it. Sir, ſaid he, then
proceeding, Remember the Proverb, <hi>He that</hi> England <hi>means to win,
with</hi> Ireland <hi>muſt begin.</hi> That is a Proverb I have often heard,
quoth <hi>Polydorus;</hi> but if I Lend you this Threeſcore Thouſand
Pounds, I'le have all <hi>Ireland</hi> to my ſelf, I'le ſend Officers of my
own to take Charge of all the Imployments in that Kingdom; you ſhall have
nothing to do there. Not I by my Soul, quoth <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> I will have
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do there; I'le only be your Deputy there, I'le receive the Sword
from <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> in your Name, and Execue your Commands by your
Authority.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conditions being Sign'd and Sealed between
<hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> Men and Money were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with
all the ſpeed imaginable. For <hi>Meſſalina</hi> was ſoon weary of his
Cold Embraces; having by<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106649:64"/>this time a fair Cover for whatever
ſhould after had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ſhould ſhe really chance to be Impregnated. And
therefore being preſent at the Colloque between her Husband
<hi>Lycogenes</hi> and her Champion <hi>Polydorus.</hi> She at the ſame time
tipt the wink upon <hi>Polydorus,</hi> and pointed to the middle of her
Placket; which ſo inflam'd <hi>Polydorus,</hi> that he was as ready to
Condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> as <hi>Lycogenes</hi> was to Demand of
him.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Tranſactions of a higher Nature, and a deep
Intrigue between the two Monarchs and the Monarcheſs. <hi>La Force</hi> plyd
his buſineſs with <hi>Lactil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>La Force</hi> had
brought her to his Bow, but the Conſummation of Pleaſure being interrupted,
as you have already heard; that interruption brought <hi>Lactilla</hi> to
bethi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k her ſelf. For, not to
conceal the Truth, <hi>Lactilla,</hi> honeſt <hi>Lactilla,</hi> Nurſe in
Ordinary to the <hi>Gallick</hi> Prince, ſhe from whom the Sovereign Swayer
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Scepter was to ſuck his Maſculine Inclinations,
had been dabling al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Which made her out of a Scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
begin to contrive, which way ſhe ſhould put off <hi>La Force.</hi> For,
Lord quoth ſhe, muſt I Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate the Milk that Suckles the Monarch of
Three Kingdoms. So that when <hi>La Force</hi> came to Reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his
Addreſſes to her, ſhe dealt with him like a plain good honeſt Country
Nurſe, and told him, that ſhe had placed her Affections before upon a
certain Souldier in the Life-Guard of <hi>Lycogenes</hi> (for thoſe ſort of
Cattel will be always endeavouring to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Thighs of your Court
Lawndry-Women and Nurſes, to Eek out their Preferment) who had overcome her;
and that by him ſhe was Young with Child: And truly her Pains were ſo
extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that being afraid ſomething more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106649:65"/>would come of it, ſhe was reſolv'd to prepare her
ſelf for Repentance. <hi>La Force</hi> who had an Eye that could pierce
through a Mill-ſtone, preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended what <hi>Lactilla</hi> would
beat, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancing the Price; and therefore pretending to be a Doctor;
Oh Madam quoth he, I underſtand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your extraordinary Pains:
The Gentleman who the laſt time had your laſt Favours, left his work
unfiniſh'd; ſo that what you carry in the Womb, muſt want either an Arm,
or a Leg, or a Thigh; and then if it come forth ſo imperfect, it will be the
cauſe of great Trouble and Affliction to you. But for that, be of good
Comfort, give but me the liberty, and I will make all things well and perfect,
and your Travel ſhall be as Eaſie as the flipping of a Cherry-Stone from
between your Thumb and Fore-finger. <hi>La Force</hi> made this ſo
demonſtrable by Dent of Argument to <hi>Lactilla,</hi> that for future
Convenience-ſake ſhe condeſcended to whatever he could deſire.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Laforce</hi> lay thus at Rack and Manger with his dear
<hi>Lactilla, Polydorus</hi> chaſſing for his laſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, long'd
for a ſecond Tryal of his Abilities. But the preſence of <hi>Lycogenes</hi>
was a new rub in his way. ,Twas therefore thought convenient to march him off
with all the ſpeed that poſſible might be; nor was <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
leſs deſirous to be rid of him, as one whoſe Reign over her Affections
was now as much at an end, as his Reign over the hearts of his People.
<hi>Polydorus</hi> therefore ſends for <hi>Lycogenes,</hi> and having agreed
upon Conditions, haſtens him away into <hi>Hibernia,</hi> with permiſſion
to retain the Title of <hi>Lycogenes</hi> the Second, King of
<hi>Hibernia,</hi> but to deliver the real Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom to
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> and the Command of all his Souldiers and Forces to ſuch
Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106649:65"/>as he had order'd to accompany
him.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>Lycogenes</hi> was departed, <hi>Polydorus</hi>
proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes his Amour with great heat; nor was <hi>Meſſalina</hi> who had
already ſurrender'd up her Fort, leſs diligent to afford <hi>Polydorus</hi>
all the Opportunities that could be with Circumſpection and Caution omitted:
She was mainly deſirous of a Prince to be Born of her Body; by which means
ſhe might bequeath perpetual vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the Chriſtians: And to that
purpoſe ſhe thought that now ſhe had both change of Air and variety of
Perſons, ſhe could not fail; and as for the Legality of it, ſhe never
minded that, ſince ſhe could have Abſolution when ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polydorus</hi> therefore therefore ſends her an Invitation
to his Country Palace of <hi>Verſellais,</hi> and appoints her an Apartment
not far from his own, with ſo many private avenues to it, that it was
impoſſible one would have thought to have made the leaſt diſcovery of
their private Congreſſes.</p>
                  <p>Under the Covert of this Retirement, <hi>Polydorus</hi> had
ſeveral Opportunities to enjoy the Carreſies of his endearing
<hi>Meſſalina;</hi> while ſhe on the one ſide la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd for Pregnancie,
and he on the other endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to recover the Reputation he had loſt in his
firſt Venereal Attempts: Nothing could out-vie the Dalliances of theſe two
Royal Lovers, unleſs the efforts of Youthful <hi>Clepatra,</hi> to pleaſe
her <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> or the Gallantries of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> to
gratifie his adored <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Meſſalina</hi>
thought that if now ſhe ſhould prove with Child, the World would be the
ſooner Convinc'd of the Truth of her being Deliver'd of the Prince of the
<hi>Cambro Britans;</hi> which made her more eager to devote her ſelf to the
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of her <hi>Polydorus.</hi> However Love had only
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106649:66"/>a Deſign to exert his power, and would not admit
<hi>Lucina</hi> to come in for a ſhare, in bleſſing the ſtrong
Endeavours of the Amorous Pair with effectual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: 'Tis true Fame did
her part and ſpread abroad a rumour over all <hi>Gothland</hi> and
<hi>Albion,</hi> that <hi>Meſſalina</hi> was with Child, and ſo it holds;
but as to that, it is leſt to Time to make out the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Cupid,</hi> who ſeem'd to ſtudy nothing
more then to enlarge the Conqueſts of <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s Charming Eyes,
had ſmitten the Heart of Young <hi>Delphinus,</hi> only Son of
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> who began to be no leſs Enamour'd of the Bewitching
<hi>Meſſalina</hi> then his Father. 'Tis true he knew nothing of certainty
of what paſs'd every Day between his Father and her. For now it being known
that <hi>Lycogenes</hi> was gone of <hi>Polydorus</hi>'s Errand, it was eaſie
to feign pretences of Frequent Conſultations with <hi>Meſſalina;</hi> but
as the Actions of Princes will be pry'd into, in ſpight of Fate,
<hi>Delphinus</hi> had ſome Inkling of the Intrigue. And indeed the more then
ordinary Credulity and Obſequiouſnes of <hi>Polydorus</hi> to an Exild
Princeſs, could not chooſe but Enhance her Suſpition. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Love is
ſuch a Tyrant, that what he will, he will have done. The Young
<hi>Delphinus</hi> is enflam'd, and tho' he were pretty ſure, that in giving
way to his Paſſion, he muſt be his Father's Rival, and Fiſh in the
ſame Stream with his own Parent, yet his Ardour was ſo Violent, that
thoſe Conſiderations could not with-hold him, nor ſtem the violent
Current of his Affection: So that he never came into <hi>Meſſalina</hi>'s
Company but his Amorous Looks betray'd the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Heart; ſo
eaſily diſcernable, that <hi>Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> could not perceive the
double Conqueſt ſhe had made both of the Father and the Son. But
<hi>Meſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> who had Abandon'd her ſelf over to the Father,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106649:66"/>made the Punctillio of Honour ſo much her preſent
Excuſe for not condeſcending to the Son's Addreſſes, that ſhe ſtill
put him off with fair Complements, ſo that all his Efforts prov'd
ineffectual.</p>
